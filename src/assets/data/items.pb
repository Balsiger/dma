ØApparatus of Kwalish2+
Dungeon Master's Guide	WTC A9219óó:GenericB¢This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.

The apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the following statistics:



\bold{Armor Class:} 20

\bold{Hit Points:} 200

\bold{Speed:} 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)

\bold{Damage Immunities:} poison, psychic



To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

 The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.

A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.



\table[Lever][Up][Down]{1}{Legs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim}{Legs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus's speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed}{2}{Forward window shutter opens.}{Forward window shutter closes.}{3}{Side window shutters open (two per side)}{Side window shutters close (two per side).}{4}{Two claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus.}{The claws retract.}{5}{Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hi, reach 5ft., one target.

Dungeon Master's Guide	WTC A9219ôö:GenericBœ	This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the \Place{Astral Plane}. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a \Item{Heward's handy haversack}, \Item{portable hole}, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the \Place{Astral Plane}. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the \Place{Astral Plane}. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.JOThis bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions.rbag of holding.jpeg08jBag

Dungeon Master's Guide	WTC A9219πª:GenericBﬁThis fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be u ed to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.

You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, Heward's handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the \Place{Astral Plane}. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the \Place{Astral Plane}. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.J"A hole that can be carried around.rportable hole.webp08jBlack Cloth

Characters who enslave others or engage in acts of senseless cruelty can never attune to such a weapon unless they atone and grow to be better people ‚Äî such a creature who attempts to attune to the weapon takes 22 (4d10) radiant damage and drops it. \God{Eilistraee} favours those whose actions bring beauty into the world, but does not care for rigid codes or firm rules. She has a special softspot for those of checkered pasts who sincerely seek to self-improve.

A singing sword functions as a +1 weapon (either courtblade or greatsword), and its fine craftsmanship increases its damage die by one step (to a d12 for courtblades, and 2d8 for greatswords). Additionally, as a bonus action, a wielder can initiate its battle song, which lasts for 1 hour, or until the weapon is sheathed, dropped, or deactivated as a bonus action. Allies within 60 feet who can hear the song, including the wielder, cannot be charmed or frightened, and any such effect is suppressed on them so long as they are affected by the song. Additionally, affected creatures add a d4 to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws so long as they can hear the song.

Once this property is used, it cannot be use again until the next dawn. Alternatively, an attuned creature can recharge this effect by taking 10 minutes to play a song for the sword, and making a DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check. On a success, the sword instantly recharges this ability.

 On a failure, this cannot be attempted again until the following dawn. Each additional time this is done in a day, the DC for the check increases by 5.

 The twelve singing swords, and their various statuses, are as follows:\list{\bold{Feradas:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \NPC{Qilue}, who dove into the \Place{Pit of Ghaunadaur} and did battle with its monstrosities to win the \Group{Keepers of the Song} enough time to seal it off. Her body, and the sword, were never recovered.

Never returned.}{\bold{Nylgoth:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \NPC{Ryzz}, who was deployed on a mission to find the \Item{Throne of Syglaeth Audark}. Never returned.}{\bold{Tritz:} Greatsword; previously wielded by \NPC{Vykus}, who was deployed in an attack on a cult of \God{Ghaunadaur on the Twisted Caverns}. The mission was a success, but at great cost ‚Äî \NPC{Vykus} was swallowed by a beast of \God{Ghaunadaur}, and her body, as well as her sword, were never recovered.}{\bold{Azurith:} Greatsword; previously wielded by \NPC{Vandin}, who was caught in an ambush by drow on the \Place{Crystal Labyrinth} while investigating signs of \God{Juiblex}‚Äôs influence there. Only one member of the unit, \NPC{Fimdell}, made it back, and he did so without his superior‚Äôs sword.}{\bold{Momath:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \NPC{Oren}, who was betrayed and pushed through a gate into the tenth floor of \Place{Undermountain}, where the \Monster{drow} of \Group{House Auvryndar} made quick work of her.}{\bold{Vitanna:} Greatsword; previously wielded by \NPC{Trun}, who is thought to have been killed while on a scouting mission in \Place{Waterdeep}. The sword is in the possession of a noble, but no one knows which.}{\bold{Sornafein:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \NPC{Selddar}, who tried to establish a secondary base of operations in \Place{Slitherswamp}. The base was partially-built when, all of a sudden, messages from it stopped. No one is certain what become of Sornafein or its wielder.}J¶Twelve singing swords, bestowed by Eilistraee, are either greatswords or courtblades.

Dungeon Master's Guide	WTC A9219»»:GenericB÷A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell's components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.

If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.\table[Spell Level][Rarity][Save DC][Attack Bonus]{Cantrip}{Common}{13}{+5}{1st}{Common}{13}{+5}{2nd}{Uncommon}{13}{+5}{3rd}{Uncommon}{15}{+7}{4th}{Rare}{15}{+7}{5th}{Rare}{17}{+9}{6th}{Very rare}{17}{+9}{7th}{Very rare}{18}{+10}{8th}{Very rare}{18}{+10}{9th}{Legendary}{19}{+11} A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied.

Dungeon Master's Guide	WTC A9219 À:GenericBÜThis staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2 charges.

\sub{Power Strike.} When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.

\sub{Spells.} While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: \Spell{cone of cold} (5 charges), \Spell{fireball} (5th-level version, 5 charges), \Spell{globe of invulnerability} (6 charges), \Spell{hold monster} (5 charges), \Spell{levitate} (2 charges), \Spell{lightning bolt} (5th-level version, 5 charges), \Spell{magic missile} (1 charge), \Spell{ray of enfeeblement} (1 charge), or \Spell{wall of force} (5 charges).

\sub{Retributive Strike.} You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 x the number of charges in the taff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw.

You can make a melee attack using the snake head, which has a reach of 5 feet. Your proficiency bonus applies to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 poison damage.

The snake head can be attacked while it is animate. It has an Armor Class of 15 and 20 hit points. If the head drops to 0 hit points, the staff is destroyed.

œStone of Golorr2-
Waterdeep - Dragon Heist	WTC C4658¿¿:GenericBÿThe Stone of Golorr is a glossy, greenish-gray stone that fits in the palm of your hand. The stone is actually an \Monster{aboleth} named \NPC{Golorr}, transformed by magic into an object.

\em{\bold{Legend Lore.}} The Stone of Golorr has 3 charges and regains ld3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the stone, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the legend lore spell.

By using the stone to cast legend lore, you communicate directly with the aboleth, and it shares its knowledge with you. The aboleth can't lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.

The aboleth koows where Lord Neverember's secret vault is located. It also knows that three keys are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon named Aurinax (red dragon instead?) inhabits the vault and guards its treasures.

\em{\bold{Failed Memory.}} When your attunement to the Stone of Colorr ends, you must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving  throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A remove curse spell cast on you has a 20 percent chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a \Spell{greater restoration} spell does so automatically.

\em{\bold{Sentience.}} The Stone of Golorr is a sentient lawful evil magic ilem with an Intelligence or 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. In addition, the aboleth learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.

The Stone of Golorr hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see 'Sentient Magic Items' in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

\em{\bold{Personality.}} The Stone ofGolorr has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god.

\em{\bold{Destroying the Stone.}} While in stone form, the aboleth isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Golorr is immune to all damage. Casting an \Spell{antipathy/sympathy} spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and \NCP{Golorr} the \Monster{aboleth} appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see.

\em{\bold{Eyes.}} The stone has three eyes that can be removed. If the stone is blinded, it is inert. With one eye restored, the Stone can communicate, but still not see the secrets it once contained. With 2 eyes restored, the Stone (and a character attuned to it) can now 'see' the location of the remaining Eye and the immediate area around it. With all 3 Eyes restored, the Stone is fully restored and operates normally again.J6A greenish-gray stone of tremendous power of the mind.rstone of golorr - blinded.pngrstone of golorr - one eye.pngrstone of golorr - two eyes.pngrstone of golorr.png*
