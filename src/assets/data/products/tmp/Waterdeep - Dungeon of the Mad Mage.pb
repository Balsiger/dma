#Waterdeep - Dungeon of the Mad Mage	WTC C4639FF:GenericBÁThis young \Monster{green dragon}, once a lawful evil creature, experienced a change in alignment and personality when an adventurer impaled it through the skull with a sentient, emerald-bladed \Item{sword of sharpness} named \NPC{Tearulai}. The \Monster{dragon} now refers to itself as \NPC{Tearulai} and has the longsword's neutral good alignment. It sleeps atop a platform overlooking the \Place{River of the Depths}, guarding its treasure.

\NPC{Wyllow} once set adventurers against \NPC{Valdemar}, hoping to destroy the evil \Monster{dragon}, but the \Monster{dragon}'s change of alignment caused \NPC{Wyllow} to reconsider their relationship. Now that \NPC{Valdemar} and \NPC{Tearulai} are one, the archdruid considers the \Monster{dragon} part of \Place{Wyllowwood}'s ecosystem. The two currently enjoy a peaceful coexistence.J‘Once an evil dragon slain by a magic sword, Tearulai is now a good-aligned guardian dragon coexisting peacefully with the archdruid \NPC{Wyllow}.rvaldemar.png"
