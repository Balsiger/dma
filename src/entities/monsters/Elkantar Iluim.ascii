  description: "Elkantar was the consort of \\NPC{Qilue Veladorn}, the previous head of the Chosen of Eilistraee. When \\NPC{Qilue} died, Elkantar fell into a heavy bout of depression from which he has not yet recovered. He no longer performs, and takes no great pleasure in life anymore. He does not participate in dances to the goddess, and his faith has been on the wane. In the words of \\NPC{Iljrene}, the Song has gone quiet within him. He gets by, day-to-day, and focuses on the security of the \\Place{Promenade} to distract himself from his guilt over not being there to save \\NPC{Qilue}. He wields one of the twelve \\Item{Singing Swords} gifted to the Chosenâ€”a heavy greatsword which he swings with impressive finesse."
