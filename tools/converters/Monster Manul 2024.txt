Aarakocra are birdlike folk who soar the skies of
countless worlds and the endless expanses of the
Elemental Plane of Air. They often resemble avians
common to the lands where they dwell; some resemble
hawks or condors, while others appear similar to
hummingbirds or archaeopteryxes. In many lands,
aarakocra tell of their ancient heroics resisting the
wicked Queen of Chaos alongside the mysterious
Wind Dukes of Aaqa.

In aquatic abysses, aboleths dream of dead empires
and orchestrate plots that unfold across ages. These
elusive, amphibious immortals physically and mentally
overwhelm their victims and transform creatures
with a slimy, aberrant infection, reshaping
other beings to serve them beneath the waves.
Aboleths possess terrifying intellects and have
alien mindsets. These creatures possess perfect
memories of proto-worlds and incomprehensible
dominions from the multiverse's earliest eons. Their
secrets are innumerable and unfathomable. Aboleths
lurk in places awash in primordial mysteries:
the ruins of aquatic empires, hidden magical nexuses,
or weak places between planes of existence. In
these lairs, aboleths dream of epochs past, collect
throngs of psychically dominated servants, consume
the minds of unwitting victims, and prepare
for their return to power.
Aboleths'alien goals and methods are often mysterious
to other creatures. Roll on or choose a result
from the Aboleth Schemes table to inspire an aboleth's
schemes.

Aboleths usually dwell in submerged ruins and caverns.
They keep air-filled spaces for their terrestrial
servants and to hold treasures that would be damaged
by water.

can use its telepathy as if it were in the illusion's

Immortal Regent of the Wild
Habitat Planar (Beastlands); Treasure: Relics
Animal lords are the immortal spirits of legendary
animals. They serve as the divine protectors of
animals of their kind, and they appear as hybrids
of humanoids and the animals they defend. They
frequently change into giant, idealized versions of
the animals they're associated with-albeit with
glowing eyes. When contending with people, they
sometimes appear as humanlike beings with subtle,
animal-like features. No matter their appearance,
animal lords exhibit the instincts and predilections
of the animals they represent, tempered by their intellect
and experience.
Most animal lords make their homes in the Beast-
Iands, but they occasionallyjourney to the Feywild
or other idyllic realms. They rarely travel to the Material
Plane, making exceptions only when a world
faces environmental disaster or droves of animals
are otherwise in jeopardy.
Among the best-known animal lords are those
that represent cats, hawks, lizards, and wolves, but
animal lords exist for beasts of all types. Some animal
lords even embody creatures that are rare or
extinct on Material Plane worlds, like megafauna
or dinosaurs. Using their divine might, animal lords
can summon spectral animals, channel spiritual
energy, and exhibit powers associated with one
of three broad groups: foragers, hunters, or sages.
These powers are tied to an animal lord's personality
and traits associated with the creature it resembles.
Roll on or choose results from the relevant
Animal Lord Appearances table to inspire what
creature an animal lord resembles.

Oversize insects, ankhegs burrow close to the surface,
creating sprawling underground labyrinths.
From these tunnels, they burst forth to dissolve and
devour smaller creatures using their acid-dripping
mandibles and sprays of digestive enzymes.
Ankhegs are the bane of farmers whose grazing
livestock are easy prey for these monsters. Many
ankhegs hunt alone, but those in places with ample
food might collect in nests of several dozen and
threaten whole towns. Ankheg nests can be challenging
to wipe out unless the monsters'tunnels are
cleared out and their eggs destroyed.
Ankheg tunnels are roughly cylindrical and are
often littered with the remains of ankhegs' meals
and subterranean treasures. Roll on or choose a

While all yugoloths are fiendish manifestations of
wickedness and greed, arcanaloths bend their considerable
intellects toward hoarding and exploiting
secrets. They then deploy these secrets to ensnare
countless victims and lesser villains, beguiling foes
with false promises and powerful magic.
Arcanaloths possess considerable spellcasting
prowess and frequently disguise themselves with
magic. While they prefer to let magical servants
or other yugoloths do their fighting for them, arcanaloths
can defend themselves with arcane might,

Ancu-HAG
Hag of Forbidden Secrets and Magical Malice
Habitat Any; Treasure: Arcana
Immortal and unpredictable, arch-hags hoard secrets
and strike magical bargains, altering fate to
indulge their fickle whims. These timeless schemers
pursue the secrets of the multiverse and work
strange magic in pursuit of their inscrutable goals.
Arch-hags are unpredictable, self-interested, and
greedy, with bizarre fascinations and affectations.
Nevertheless, they often make deals to further their
plots. These hags are fonts ofsecret knowledge,
particularly lore regarding forbidden magic and
multiversal secrets. They might share their knowledge,
but their secrets always have a price. In trade
for their secrets, arch-hags might request peculiar
errands, valuable magic items, or preternatural currency,
like one's memories, a year of one's life, or the
ability to cry.
Most arch-hags avoid battle, but if forced to fight,
they unleash dangerous magic, such as spectral
claws, arcing lightning, and mind-bending spells. An
arch-hag can curse other magic-users, confounding
the spellcasters' incantations and forcing the
spellcasters to say the opposite of what they mean.
Even if an arch-hag is brought low, its preparations
allow it to magically slip away and begin plotting its
revenge.
Every arch-hag has a unique weakness tied to a
fateful encounter the hag had in the past or something
that embodies the antithesis of the hag's
magic. A hag goes out of its way to keep this vulnerability
secret. Although an arch-hag isn't physically
harmed by its weakness, it can be destroyed only
while its weakness is nearby. Roll on or choose a result
from the Arch-hag Anathemas table to inspire
an arch-hag's weakness.

Each arch-hag creates a magical home, such as a
hidden demiplane, a mansion atop a storm cloud,
or-in the case of the arch-hag Baba Yaga-a hut
atop giant chicken legs. The interiors of these lairs
frequently change or exhibit bewildering features.
The region containing an arch-hag's lair is altered
by its presence, creating the following effects:
Lapsus Linguae. Creatures (excluding the hag and
its allies) within 1 mile of the lair subtract 1d10
AncH-xnc
from any ability checks they make when they take
the Influence action.
Meddlesome Magic. Whenever a creature other
than the hag or its allies finishes a Long Rest
while within l mile of the lair, the next time that
creature casts a spell using a spell slot, it also casts
Confusion centered on itself. The spell uses the
creature's spellcasting ability and doesn't require
Concentration.
If the arch-hag is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere,
these effects end immediately.

Assassins are professional killers skilled at stealthily
approaching their victims and striking unseen.
Most assassins kill for a reason, perhaps hiring
themselves out to wealthy patrons or slaying for an
unscrupulous cause. They use poisons and other
deadly tools, and they might carry equipment to
help them break into secure areas or avoid capture.
Many assassins adhere to a professional code or
exhibit some signature quirk. Roll on or choose a
result from the Assassin Modus Operandi table to
inspire an assassin's distinctive habits.

AwarnNED PreNrs
Vegetation Given Magical Lift
Habitat Forest; Treasure: None
Magic can invest plants with mobility, sapience, and
even a voice. Spells such as Awaken or the influence
of other planes of existence might bring mundane
vegetation to life, while other remarkable plants
might naturally have these features.
AwernNn» §"*u,
Awakened shrubs can be any sort of small plant,
from forest bushes to clustered flowers. They often
appear near awakened trees or in regions imbued
with primal magic. Some have whimsical appearances
or foliage resembling rudimentary facial
features, while others look like animate topiary
creatures.
AwernNED TREE
Some awakened trees stand in still, meditative
states for long periods, making them easy to mistake
for normal plants, while others patrol regions
of natural power. Awakened trees are sometimes
brought to life by influences from the Feywild,
which make them colorful and endlessly blooming,
or by Shadowfell energy, which covers them with
grotesque burls or makes them look lifeless.

F lightle s s Avian Pr e d ator s
Habitat Arctic, Grassland, Hill; Treasure: None
Axe beaks are flightless, birdlike creatures with
distinctive axe-shaped beaks. Swift predators,
they chase down prey and use their beaks to hack
through foliage protecting their quarry. Axe beaks
live in varied environments. Colorfully plumed axe
beaks race across tropical plains, while axe beaks
with snowy feathers hunt the tundra.
Axe beaks are difficult to train, but those hatched
and raised in captivity can become reliable mounts.
Axn Bner
Alone or in small groups, axe beaks stalk prey to
feed their flocks. When working together, axe beaks
use rudimentary tactics, with some distracting
threats while others strike vulnerable targets or
rush young axe beaks to safety.
GraNr Axn Brlr
Giant axe beaks typically dwell in secluded, primeval
realms, such as isolated islands or underground
wildernesses. They often compete with dinosaurs
and other giant beasts for territory.

Criminals and Scoundrels

Bandits use the threat of violence to take what
they want. Such criminals include gang members,
desperadoes, and lawless mercenaries. Yet not all
bandits are motivated by greed. Some are driven
to lives of crime by unjust laws, desperation, or the
threats of merciless leaders.

Devil of Greed and Obsession
Habitat Planar (Nine Hells); Treasure: Any
Infernal collectors, barbed devils fanatically protect
troves oftreasure and scour the planes of existence
for additions to their hoards. Also known as hamatulas
among the ranks of the Nine Hells, these devils
bedeck their barbed hides with their most prized
possessions and trophies taken from those who
failed to steal from them. When threatened, barbed
devils strike with their thorny limbs and hurl infernal
flame.
Barbed devils often serve as guards and accountants
for ice devil generals, pit fiend warlords, archdevils,
and similarly powerful villains. In return,
barbed devils gain protection for their own collections.
Many barbed devils also maintain networks
of imps that search the planes for treasures of interest
or usefully greedy mortals.
Barbed devils rarely collect anything as prosaic
as coins and gems. Rather, they pride themselves
on having the multiverse's greatest collection of
one kind of thing-typically items of rare pedigree
or emblems of power. Barbed devils refuse to steal
what they covet; instead they strike bargains to
claim both treasure and mortal souls.

BenrcuRA
Demon of lnstinct qnd Primal Violence
Habitau Planar (Abyss); Treasure: Any
Barlguras are demons that embody brutality and
killer instincts. They ruthlessly hunt creatures
that enter their territories, whether such places
are Abyssal wildernesses or locations where these
demons have been conjured by wicked magic-users
Barlguras litter their territories with fiendish icons
and terrifying evidence of their kills.
Barlguras cooperate with other demons, particularly
other barlguras, so long as they have ample
prey. Should a region be depleted of creatures to
slaughter, these demons turn on one another in
frays that can devastate vast expanses.
Barlguras vary in appearance, but all have powerful
frames and hands capable of climbing swiftly
and delivering crushing blows. If brute force isn't
enough to overwhelm their foes, barlguras can use
demonic magic to conjure terrifying illusions and
grasping vines. Most barlguras resemble nightmarish
apes, and some bear exaggerated versions
of features of predators common to the lands the
barlguras inhabit. Many embed trophies from past
hunts in their demonic bodies.

Reptilian Guardian with a Petrifuing Gaze
Habitau Mountain, Underdark; Treasure: Any
Basilisks are ponderous predators with eight clawed
legs, crystalline spines, and mightyjaws. Rather
than chasing prey, they use their supernatural gaze
to turn creatures to stone and then consume these
victims at their leisure. While basilisks are most
comfortable in subterranean lairs, many are captured
and kept by unscrupulous folk seeking guardians
for their treasures.
The remains of Petrified creatures litter the area
where a basilisk hunts. These might be mundane
creatures or more unusual beings that had dire encounters
with a basilisk. Roll on or choose a result
from the Petrified Basilisk Victims table to inspire
the statues that might appear in a basilisk's hunting
grounds. There is a 5O percent chance that any
of these statues are missing limbs or broken into

Devil of Force and lntimidation
Habitat Planar (N ine H ells) ; Treasure: Armaments
Bearded devils, also known as barbazus, fill the
legions of the Nine Hells. These cruel soldiers follow
the orders of diabolical generals as they defend
infernal realms, invade Material Plane worlds, and
clash against demons in planes-spanning conflicts.
Left to their own devices, bearded devils encourage
mortals to act callously and abuse their power,
inflating their egos and inspiring petty tyrannies.
Villains aligned with the Nine Hells call on bearded
devils to serve as guardians, enforce their will, or
fight in wicked armies.
Bearded devils'eponymous beards consist of
grotesque, tentacle-like growths. These squirming,
barb-riddled beards carry poison capable of preventing
magical healing. Bearded devils are also
known for their distinctive glaives, through which
they channel hellish energy. Those struck by these
unnatural weapons suffer infernal wounds that
grow worse until stanched or magically healed.

Twelve{egged, reptilian predators, behirs endlessly
hunt for their next meal. Their short legs propel
them quickly across floors and walls. Any prey that
behirs can't chase down, they blast with breaths of
powerful lightning.
Legends claim the first behirs were magically created
by storm giants during an ancient, multiversal
conflict between giants and dragons. The giants
used their mastery of weather to alter the essence
of blue dragons. The results were the first behirs,
which served as hunters with a particular taste for
dragon eggs.
Behirs live in sprawling cave systems and elaborate
ruins where they can make the most of their
exceptional mobility. They are mindful of areas
where dragons dwell, as most dragons view behirs
as dangerous abominations and attack them on
sight. Nevertheless, behirs occasionally hunt for
dragon lairs in the hope offinding and devouring
unhatched dragon eggs.

Habitat U nderdark; Treasure: Arcana
Beholders-also known as eye tyrants-number
among the most notorious inhabitants of the Underdark.
Few creatures in the multiverse are as
loathed and feared as these maniacal horrors.
A beholder's distinctive, globular body is dominated
by an oversize maw and a gigantic central eye.
Ten stalks ending in smaller eyes crown its form.
From each of these eleven eyes, a beholder can unleash
a different magic power. The central eye can
deactivate magic, while the smaller eyes emit rays
that inflict various dooms-such as petrifying creatures,
disintegrating them, slaying them outright, or
other effects.
Beholders possess utterly alien minds. Most exhibit
paranoid, narcissistic, and megalomaniacal
tendencies, and they act on agendas beyond human
reasoning. While some keep to themselves, others
force weaker creatures into their service. Still others
cultivate grand ambitions, creating networks
of minions to manipulate groups, settlements, and
whole nations in the Underdark and sometimes the
surface world.
Few creatures loathe beholders more than other
beholders. Every beholder views itself as the physical
and intellectual pinnacle of its species. To
them, all other beholders are aberrant rivals to be
dominated or destroyed. Conflicts between beholders
can last for decades and lay waste to vast subterranean
realms.
Beholders are a particular threat to adventurers
because both gravitate toward mysterious ruins
and sites of great magic. Many beholders collect the
magic items and petrified bodies of heroes they've
defeated, displaying them as trophies.
BrHoronR LArRS
Beholders lurk in cavern complexes they've carved
using their eye rays deep in the Underdark or in
lairs created for them by their servants.
The region containing a beholder's lair is twisted
by its presence, creating the following effects:
Scopophobia. Creatures within 1 mile of the lair
feel as if they're being watched. Any creature (excluding
the beholder and its allies) that finishes
a Short Rest while within 1 mile of the lair must
succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain
no benefit from that rest.
Warping Terrain. Minor warps in reality occur
near the lair; any creature (excluding the beholder)
within l mile of the lair that makes aD2O
Test and rolls a t has the Prone condition.
If the beholder dies or moves its lair elsewhere,
these effects end immediately.

Dragons of Decay and Despair
Habitat Swamp; Treasure: Relics
Black dragons delight in suffering and ruin. While
other chromatic dragons scheme for power and
wealth, these dragons seek to tear down all they see
and rule over what remains.
Black dragons are terrifying creatures with
curved horns and withered visages suggestive of
fiendish skulls. They typically inhabit stagnant
swamps, crumbling ruins, or places of magical or
environmental corruption. Their acid breath scars
their domains, eroding the features from ancient
statues and leaving nature with festering wounds.
Black dragons hoard tarnished symbols of hope
and relics of fallen empires. The more sought-after
the treasure, the more black dragons prize it-particularly
if they were responsible for it being lost.
Brecr DnacoN'WynurrNc
Black dragon wyrmlings lurk in bogs and polluted
waterways, hunting for prey and weaker creatures
to overpower. While older wyrmlings eventually
seek their own territories, recently hatched ones
might hunt one another, seeking dominance over
their clutch and slaying rivals they can't subjugate.
YouNc Br.q.cr DnacoN
Most young black dragons claim a hidden lair-typically
a dismal place accessible through deadly ruins
or a treacherous bog. They delight in exploiting
fearful servants and might terrorize small communities
or impress groups of kobolds or troglodytes
into their service. Some ally themselves with powerful
undead such as death knights and vampires or
aberrations such as aboleths and kuo-toa.

By the time they're adults, black dragons are
among the greatest terrors in the lands they claim.
Wretched swamps and monster-haunted ruins
grow more dismal and spread under an adult black
dragon's influence. Morbid cultists and doomsayers
frequently gather in the dragon's service, bringing
with them undead terrors that answer to the black
dragon and aid it in spreading ruin to nearby bastions
of beauty and peace.
ANcrnNr Brecr DnacoN
Ancient black dragons plot the ruin of whole
realms. They seek magic to corrupt the land, raise
undead hordes, bind fiends, and replicate magical disasters.
Ancient black dragons strive to create vast,
dead domains where they are the greatest things
that remain.
Black dragons lurk in dismal ruins, polluted bogs, or
other sites gripped by decay.
The region containing an adult or ancient black
dragon's lair is warped by its presence, creating the
following effects:
Acrid Haze. Odorous and stifling fog covers the
area within 1 mile of the lair, rendering that area
Lightly Obscured. Travel for creatures other than
the dragon and its allies takes twice the usual time
in that area.
Foul Water. Water sources within 1 mile of the lair
are supernaturally fouled. A creature that drinks
such water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or have the Poisoned condition for 1
hour.
If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these
effects end immediately.

Plants Sprouted from Evil
Habitat: Forest; Treasure: None
Blights are malicious plants that sprout from
deep-rooted evil. Their gnarled forms twist with
fearsome features suggestive of human limbs and
vicious maws. Blights lurk in ambush amid mundane
vegetation and lash out at non-Plant creatures.
While blights can act independently, they're usually
motivated by whatever sinister forces spawned
them or by wicked creatures with control over nature.
The magic that creates blights often affects
other vegetation as well, causing brambles, vines,
and gnarled trees to overwhelm roads and fields,
choke wells and streams, and force animals from
their natural habitat. This might make blights the
first sign of an oncoming wave of corruption.
TWrc Brrcnr
Resembling bundles of sticks or dead brush, twig
blights easily blend in among deadwood, flotsam,
and the wood piles common in many rural settings.
Groups ofthem are often found near river crossings,
forgotten wells, or natural campsites, where
they ambush those who let down their guard.

VINB BucHr
Vine blights resemble humans wrapped in vines
common to the areas in which they grow, from
hairy ivy vines to flowering kudzu. They can cause
plants to burst from the ground around themselves
and entangle nearby foes.
Unlike most other blights, vine blights can speak.
They do so rarely, typically only to convey messages
from their masters or to repeat the words of their
victims in rasping voices.
Tnnr Brrcnr
Tree blights look like ancient, dead trees with
gnarled limbs and splintered hollows. Imbued with
bloodlust, these blights feed on the living. Evidence
of their past meals is often tangled amid their
branches and roots. Tree blights cooperate with
other blights, but they attack other tree-shaped
beings they encounter, such as awakened trees and
treants.
Gurrnres BLIGHT
Ancient plants twisted by evil, Gulthias blights feed
on blood and despoil the surrounding land, often
giving rise to subservient blights. These cursed
plants take their name from the story of their creation;
the first of their kind was a tree that grew
from the stake piercing the heart of the vampire
Gulthias. These blights consider all creatures either
servants or fertilizer for the blights' corruption.

Elusive Feywild Canine
Habitaü Forest, Planar (Feywild); Treasure: None
Blink dogs glimmer with a magic that allows them
to teleport, "blinking" from one spot to another.
These dogs use this power to chase prey, baffle foes,
and express joy. They're frequently found among
Feywild folk, such as centaurs and pixies-often as
members of rollicking hunts between worlds.

All-Consuming Cosmic Entropy Unleashed
Habitat Any; Treasure: Any
The blob of annihilation is a coagulation of cosmic
entropy conjoined to the remains of dead gods.
This malicious entity drifts through Wildspace and
multiversal expanses inimical to life-vast regions
where the chance of encountering it is low.
The blob poses the greatest threat when disasters
or nihilistic magic-users summon it to inhabited
realms. Once unleashed, the blob of annihilation
rolls across the land in vast, cosmic gyres, with
fragments of the blob splitting off to engulf targets.
The blob consumes anything it encounters, sweeping
forests, villages, and fortresses into its mass.
Within the blob is an expanse without air or gravity
where entropic forces destroy whatever they engulf.
Nothing can survive within for long.
Only magic items and the corpses of gods and
titans can endure inside the blob. Because ofthat
fact, treasure hunters and theologians sometimes
give themselves the deadly task of trying to retrieve
something from within the blob. This quest usually
ends in annihilation, but occasionally it results in
the find of a lifetime.
When the blob appears, roll on or choose a result
from the Blob of Annihilation Contents table to inspire
what extraordinary thing remains within its
goop.

Dragons of Tyranny and Tempests
Habitat Coastal, Desert; Treasure: Relics
Arrogant and imperious, blue dragons are chromatic
dragons that crave control and collect followers
like other dragons hoard treasure. They seek to
transform their territories into empires, domains to
be feared by nations.
Blue dragons have sharp features with piercing
horns and scales that range from sapphire to the
shades of stormy skies. They dwell in deserts and
badlands, particularly regions with dramatic spires
from whose tops they might see for miles. They
seek lairs near sites of symbolic power, such as the
abandoned fortresses ofgiants, the colossi offallen
empires, or monuments raised by their followers.
Regalia of rulership and artistic masterpieces fill
blue dragons'hoards. These dragons have no interest
in treasures that are common or flawed, preferring
one-of-a-kind gemstones, the crowns of fallen
royals, and magic items capable of spreading the
dragons' influence.
Brur DnecoN WynurrNc
Blue dragon wyrmlings often serve other powerful
creatures, learning the ways of control and establishing
fearful reputations among weaker creatures.
Many wyrmlings initially serve loyally, but as their
powers grow to match their ambitions, they eventually
betray or abandon their associates. These
wyrmlings tempt small groups of creatures into
their service, rewarding them with modest treasures
and promises of future power.

YouNc Brur DnecoN
Young blue dragons seek to establish themselves as
forces to be feared. Many claim isolated communities
to rule over or ancient ruins where they might
find magical paths to power. These blue dragons
might temporarily cooperate with other dragons or
powerful villains to gain followers and influence.
A»urr Brun DnecoN
Adult blue dragons command small empires, which
might be territories of subjugated followers, shadowy
criminal networks, or cultic enclaves. Endlessly
suspicious and wary of rivals, these dragons enact
elaborate schemes to ruin their foes, test the loyalty
of their servants, and ensure their dominance for
centuries.
ANcrnur Brun DnlcoN
Ancient blue dragons think beyond dominating
groups of short{ived servants. Instead, they seek
to claim their places above other dragons and their
world's most powerful inhabitants. If world domination
seems too tedious or clichd, these dragons
might seek to seize control of extraplanar realms,
multiworld empires, or forces of reality-like life,
storms, or time itself.
Brur DnacoN Lerns
Blue dragons dwell in arid lands. Their lairs might
be death traps meant to entomb invaders or ostentatious
fortresses where they plot domination.
The region containing an adult or ancient blue
dragon's lair is changed by its presence, creating the
following effects:
Sinkholes. Sinkholes form more frequently in the
area within 1 mile of the lair. Whenever a creature
in that area other than the dragon and its allies
finishes a Long Rest, roll 1d20. On a 1, a sinkhole
opens beneath the creature, and the creature
must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw
or fall2d4, 10 feet into the sinkhole.
Spiteful Storms. Dust devils and thunderstorms
rage within 1 mile of the lair. The area is Lightly
Obscured.
If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these
effects end immediately.

Devil of Dread and Obedience
Habitah Planar (Nine Hells); Treasure: lmplements
Bone devils are gaunt, nightmarish Fiends with
pallid skin stretched tight over frames that combine
human and insectile features. Also known as
osyluths, these Fiends command weaker devils and
other beings aligned with infernal legions. Bone
devils ensure that the commands of hellish sovereigns
are exacted efficiently and that non-devils
fulfill their commitments to the Nine Hells. They
slay those who renege on infernal deals, sending
treacherous mortal souls to face unspeakable
punishments.
When not serving their diabolical masters, bone
devils tempt self-obsessed mortals with promises
of other creatures' adulation and obedience. These
devils prop up petty tyrants, helping them grow increasingly
calloused and amoral.
Bone devils travel across the multiverse to fulfill
diabolical orders. If left with no other choices, they
might conscript mortals to aid them in their vicious
goals. Roll on or choose a result from the Bone
Devil Objectives table to inspire a bone devil's goals.

Nagas are immortal but not invincible, and powerful
magic can end their lives. Bone nagas are skeletal
terrors raised from the remains of magically
slain nagas or nagas that were killed but that hadn't
yet rejuvenated. They are granted unlife through
rituals practiced by cultists, yuan-ti, and morbid
spirit nagas. These Undead nagas possess magical
abilities similar to those they had in life, along with
an eerie gaze that can beguile other creatures.
Bone nagas typically obey those who resurrected
them, serving their creators as tireless guards and
sharing the lore they collected in life. Undeath disrupts
the perfect memory bone nagas enjoyed while
alive, leaving them with gaps in their memories or
details scrambled into puzzle-like jumbles.
In rare cases, bone nagas continue to pursue the
goals they had while alive instead of serving other
creatures. Most free-willed bone nagas are evil beings
raised from spirit naga remains, but in unusual
instances, bone nagas created from guardian nagas
continue good, albeit confused, existences.

Dragons of Lore and Rapport
Habitat: Desert; Treasure: Arcana
Gregarious and outgoing, brass dragons relish sharing
knowledge and stories. Although these metallic
dragons favor arid lands, they cheerfullyjourney
considerable distances to visit friendly creatures,
pass on what they've learned, and collect news.
Though good natured, brass dragons don't shirk

from combat when necessary, thwarting foes with
magical sleep and searing them with flame.
Brass dragons favor warm climes, particularly
steppes and rocky or sandy deserts, and they usually
dwell near prominent crossroads or oases that
regularly draw visitors. They enjoy adopting Humanoid
forms, disguising themselves as traveling
merchants, scholars, storytellers, or anyone else
invested in others' stories.
Brass dragons collect eclectic objects. While such
items might seem like knickknacks, each is part of a
story-perhaps a nostalgic memento or evidence of
a tale passed into myth. An old friend's hat and the
crown of the last ruler of a forgotten dynasty could
occupy the same shelf in a brass dragon's hoard.
Bnass DnecoN WynurrNc
Brass dragon wyrmlings are relentlessly curious.
These dragons eagerly engage approachable creatures
and are quick to explore any place that has an
interesting story. Once they hear tales ofadventure,
many are keen to start their own quests.

Young brass dragons travel extensively, often
spending a few years in a region before circling back
to their lair. Some work closely with other metallic
dragons, carrying information between allies.
Anurr Bnass DnecoN
Adult brass dragons know many secrets and have
vast networks of contacts. These dragons share
perspectives they've learned from across the world
and passionately combat the lies of con artists and
villains that lead people astray.
ANcrrNlPness nnecoN
Ancient brass dragons create worlds-spanning networks.
They combat forces of repression and misinformation,
helping people learn from the mistakes
of the past. Either personally or through webs of
messengers, ancient brass dragons keep allies informed
about challenges they can face together.
Aucrerur Bnnss Dnlcor.r
Bnass DnecoN Lerns
Brass dragons usually dwell in secret caves and canyons
near well-traveled routes.
The area containing an adult or ancient brass
dragon's lair is altered by its presence, creating the
following effects:
Mirages. While in its lair, the dragon can cast Major
Image, requiring no Material components and using
the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting
action. When casting the spell this way, the spell's
range is I mile, and the dragon doesn't need to see
the spot where the illusion appears.
Refreshing Water. Water within 1 mile of the lair
is magically refreshing. A creature that drinks
such water gains 2d4 Temporary Hit Points, and
the dragon is immediately aware of the creature's
presence.
If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these
effects end immediately. I

the works of past civilizations to new discoveries,
and they share such works widely. When dealing
with shorter-lived beings, bronze dragons prefer to
win them over through conversation and cultivation,
but they don't shy from battle when villains
keep others from achieving their potential.
Bronze dragons enjoy the power and endless possibilities
of the sea, and they often make their lairs
in places of natural beauty or communities they
wish to preserve. Within their dwellings, bronze
dragons hoard things they believe will be useful one
day. They salvage treasure lost to the sea, reclaiming
wealth or sunken ships.

Bronze dragon wyrmlings believe they can solve

might then need help correcting mistakes.

collect friends with varied expertise, cultivating
a community of experts they can rely on.

Adult bronze dragons often dwell near places they
defend or where they help others work toward
goals. They might become patrons of whole cities,
advising leaders and helping generations flourish.
ANcrBNr BnoNzn DnecoN
Ancient bronze dragons develop dramatic patinas
on their glimmering scales. These dragons strive to
protect whole regions, continents, or planets from
threats. They seek solutions to planes-spanning calamities
or multiversal perils and oppose the evil of
mighty chromatic dragons.
BnoNzn DnecoN Larns
Bronze dragons usually make their homes near or
under the sea.
The region containing an adult or ancient bronze
dragon's lair is changed by its presence, creating the
following effects:
Buoying Currents. Creatures within 1 mile of the
lair that lack a Swim Speed ignore the extra cost
of movement while swimming.
Sun and Storms. While in its lair, the dragon can
cast ControlWeather, requiring no Material components
and using the same spellcasting ability as
its Spellcasting action. When casting the spell this
way, the dragon can control the weather within I
mile of its lair, regardless if the dragon is inside or
outside.
If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these
effects end immediately.

Mortal lnfused with Fiendish Might
Habital Any; Treasure: Relics
Cambions are former mortals corrupted by fiendish
power or possessed by insidious forces. While
tieflings are free-willed individuals with a hint of
fiendish ancestry, cambions are inherently tied to or
remade by the wicked magic of the Lower Planes.
Many cambions serve the malevolent forces that
are the source of their powers. Others seek to claim
the might of whatever created them or to seize
otherworldly powers of their own. Among the most
notorious of such cambions is Iuz, a villain who became
an evil demigod and whose villainous nation
threatens the Free City of Greyhawk on Oerth.
Cambions come into being in disparate ways. Roll
on or choose a result from the Cambion Origins table
to determine the source of a cambion's fiendish
might.

Habitat Underdark, Urban; Treasure: None
Ravenous corpse eaters, carrion crawlers gravitate
toward places of slaughter and decay. In such charnel
environs, they feast on the dead with no qualms
about their meals'origins or freshness.
Carrion crawlers have segmented bodies like
gigantic cutworms. From beneath their multipart
maws protrude eight thin, lashing tentacles. Creatures
struck by these tentacles risk being paralyzed
and consumed.
Carrion crawlers scour sewers, battlefields, necropolises,
and fetid wildernesses for corpses, clinging
to ceilings to ambush smaller prey and to avoid
competing hunters. They're drawn to light and the
scent of blood, recognizing them as signs of food.
These scavengers avoid ingesting inorganic material.
Crypts with funeral armors sucked clean of
their corpses and eerily pristine catacombs are signs
of infestation by carrion crawlers.

Devil of Pain and Control
Habitau Planar (Nine Hells); Treasure: lmplements
Also known as kytons, chain devils consider themselves
morbid artisans who use deception, menace,
and vicious metal to coerce prisoners into betraying
themselves. Many serve powerful devils, wrenching
secrets from imprisoned souls using deadly, animate
chains. Left to their own devices, chain devils
encourage ruthless individuals to pursue forbidden
magic, leading their pupils down paths to the Nine
Hells.
Along with psychological threats and physical
harm, a chain devil uses its unnerving gaze to make
its victims perceive their worst fear rather than the
monster. Roll on or choose a result from the Chain
Devil Masks table to inspire a chain devil's fearful
appearance.

Violent and unpredictable, chimeras combine the
deadliest traits of lions, rams, and red dragons.
With their fearsome claws, crushing horns, and
fiery breath, chimeras are tempests of ferocity,
driven by their three heads' conflicting instincts.
Their heads agree on little but their desires to feed
and to drive competitors from the rugged territories
where these monsters make their lairs. When they
spot prey, chimeras typically strafe foes with their
fire breath before landing to attack with their fangs,
horns, and claws.
Owing to their draconic instincts, chimeras are
greedy creatures that hoard treasures within cavernous
lairs. They're undiscerning about what they
collect, gathering shiny objects alongside trophies
and bones from their recent kills. Brave souls seeking
to distract or temporarily appease a chimera can
do so by offering it treasure and food.

Chitinous Servant of Primeval Powers
Habital Coastal, Swamp, Underdark; Treasure: Relics
Chuuls originated in forgotten ages when aboleths
and stranger beings ruled alien empires beneath
the waves. The aboleths transformed numerous
deep-sea predators into servants that could venture
beyond the seas to claim more magic and creatures
to exploit. Chuuls are the most enduring of these
bizarre servants.
Many chuuls serve aboleth overlords, carrying
out their whims amid lightless seas and primeval
swamps. Other chuuls obey new aberrant masters,
such as beholders, grells, or mind flayers. Some
chuuls follow their own drives, endlessly collecting
ancient magic treasures or interpreting age-old
orders to bizarre ends. Regardless oftheir agendas,
chuuls snare creatures in their massive pincers
before rendering foes helpless with their paralytic
tentacles.
Chuuls don't age and can lie dormant in hidden
places for millennia before threats, ancient orders,
or strange compulsions awaken them.

Clay golems are magical defenders made from earth
and clay to protect places or communities. The
materials used in creating clay golems originate
from near the location the golems protect and often
have special significance to their creators, such as
clay from a holy site or bricks from a magical ruin.
While some clay golems are masterfully sculpted
to resemble living beings, others have only vaguely
humanlike forms.
These golems obey their creators' orders and protect
what their makers value most. Some still follow
these orders long after their creators'deaths. Roll
on or choose a result from the Clay Golem Orders
table to inspire the commands a clay golem follows.

Haunter in the Dark
Habital U nderdark; Treasure: I mplements
Cloakers are mysterious Underdark predators,
named by adventurers for their resemblance to
hanging cloaks when they cling to walls. What
cloakers call themselves is unknown, if they refer to
themselves at all. Though they're undeniably intelligent,
their behavior is often inscrutable.
Cloakers sometimes gather in Underdark enclaves,
but they rarely build settlements or form social
structures. Most operate as solitary predators, lurking
in dismal subterranean reaches or abandoned
dungeons-sometimes for months at a time-as they
wait for prey to pass. They use their mottled hides
to blend in with their surroundings. When unsuspecting
prey nears, cloakers unfurl and attempt
to latch on and then smother their victims in their
powerful wings.
Cloakers delight in frightening foes. In addition
to their methods of ambush, cloakers can create
illusory duplicates of themselves and emit surreal
moans that non-cloakers find terrifying in unexplainable,
primal ways. Cloakers might antagonize
explorers lost in the Underdark for days, terrorizing
and scattering them before attacking. They rarely
converse with other beings, except to whisper eerie
riddles to those they're about to consume.

Giant of the Loftiest Heights
Habital Mou ntain; Treasure: Arcana
Cloud giants use the power of the skies to observe
and subtly influence the world. These giants resemble
humans with hair ranging from silver to blue
and with skin in cloudlike shades from stark white
to twilight hues. Curved canines grow in their upper
jaws, extending past their lower lips. In battle,
they attack with weapons wreathed in storm clouds
and throw roaring thunderheads.
Most cloud giants inhabit citadels crowning tremendous
mountains or magical palaces that drift
amid the clouds. Many of these giants believe they
possess similarly lofty status or purpose. Some view
themselves as godlike beings who can manipulate
and steal from terrestrial beings with impunity.
Others claim their long lives and place among the
clouds grant them unique perspectives, so they
chronicle what they witness in the world below
without interfering. In either case, cloud giants
often possess fabulous magical treasures, either
claimed from across the world or created by (and
gigantically sized for) themselves.

Colossi are massive Constructs created by the devout
to reflect the nature of a deity, which could be

Droves of faithful artisans craft a colossus in a
shape to honor their deity, then call on that god
to infuse the statue with life. This arduous process
might take decades and involve hundreds of
workers. If the god favors the creation, the mighty
crystal at the construct's heart pulses with divine
power, and the colossus rises to protect the faithful

Most colossi were created in ages past and now
lie dormant in secluded wilderness, awakening only

do they use their deadly acid breath.
Copper dragons typically live in caverns amid
picturesque hills and rock formations-particularly
those that are prominent landmarks. These dragons
collect gifts, though they have little interest in
treasure without meaning, no matter how valuable
it is. To them, thoughtfully given presents and the
feelings or memories they symbolize are more important
than masterpieces or magical relics.

Adult copper dragons use their influence to better
the world. With broad circles of friends, adult copper
dragons delight in introducing people to one another
and helping people find places where they can
flourish. When disaster strikes, these dragons draw
on their family of contacts to offer support, right
wrongs, and rebuild stronger than before.

Ancient copper dragons use warmth and reliability
to effect change over time. They open their cozy
lairs to their friends as havens of learning and
laughter for the young and those in need. These
dragons watch for and oppose future threats while
fostering sanctuaries of simple goodness.

Copper dragons typically inhabit multichamber
caves and renovated ruins.
The region containing an adult or ancient copper
dragon's lair is changed by its presence, creating the
following effects:
Chatty Critters. Tiny Beasts magically gain the
ability to speak and understand Draconic while
within 6 miles of the lair.
Giggle Fits. Whenever a creature other than the
dragon and its allies is within I mile of the lair and
rolls a I on a D20 Test, it must succeed on a DC 15

wracked with laughter.
If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these
effects end immediately.

Coueru
Guardian Manifestation of the Divine
Habitat Desert, Forest, Grassland, Urban;
Treasurs Relics
Embodiments of prophecy and protectors of divine
secrets, couatls ensure fate unfolds as it should.
They resemble serpents with rainbow wings, and
each is a manifestation of a divine edict, a truth or
fate that a righteous god decrees must hold true for
all time. Most couatls appear in places of ancient
power, where they guard hidden magic or ensure
foretold acts do or don't come to pass. Rarely,
couatls watch over communities or travel lands in
disguise, interpreting omens or manipulating factors
to set fate on its proper course.
Motivated by eternal mandates, couatls sometimes
behave in inscrutable or antagonistic ways.
They are inflexible and uncompromising, as their
existences are fundamentally tied to their divine
directives, but they harm other creatures only when
absolutely necessary to achieve divine goals.
Each couatl goes through a period of renewal
at the end of an age. In a couatl's lifecycle, an age
might correspond to a celestial calendar or some divine
chronology. Near the age's end, the couatl lays
a wondrous, rainbow-hued egg. When the age ends,
the couatl dies. For a period-perhaps a single day,
perhaps until an annual solar event-the couatl's
work is unattended. Once this time passes, the same
couatl that laid the egg hatches from it, fully grown
and renewed to serve for another age.

Severed Appendages with Malicious Will
Habitat: Any; Treasure: None
Crawling claws are severed hands that move and
act of their own murderous accord. These deathless
appendages can spring to life from the severed
limbs of killers and villains, and sinister magic-users
might animate crawling claws as foul servants.
Crawling claws appear in a variety of forms, from
decaying human hands to the fresh appendages of
animals or monsters.
CnawrrNc Crew
Lone crawling claws can continue killing sprees
they perpetrated in life. Some recklessly attack the
living, while others pursue specific victims. In rare
cases, a crawling claw wreaks mayhem while the
rest of its body still lives, with the original creature
potentially unaware of its severed hand's crimes.
Swanu oF CRAwLTNG Craws
Swarms of crawling claws are typically animated
by depraved necromancers. Occasionally, these
grotesque swarms arise from mass graves or after
tragedies, refusing to let their murderers escape
their grasp.

Habitat: Any; Treasure: lndividual, Relics
Cultists use magic and extreme measures to spread
radical beliefs. Some privately pursue esoteric secrets,
while others form shadowy cabals seeking to
bring about terrifying ends. Cultists often follow
obscure mystical traditions or obsess over interpretations
of ancient prophecies. They might worship
supernatural patrons-deities, otherworldly creatures,
manipulative alien minds, or stranger forces.
Roll on or choose a result from the Cultist Agendas
table to inspire what a cultist seeks to achieve.
Culrrsr Acenoas
'ld5 The Cultist Strives To ...
1 Bring about the end of a dominant order, an
age, or the world.
2 Burn away the comfortable lies of reality,
revealing forgotten or terrible truths.
3 Expand their faith though mind control or
supernatural coercion.
4 Make global changes, like sinking the land or
awakening volcanoes.
5 Remake life on a mass scale, altering other
creatures' bodies or spiritual beings.
6 Summon their deity or its herald, weapon, or
realm into their world.
Occurr Svunors
Cults often identify with symbols that exemplify
their beliefs. Such symbols might mark objects important
to the cult, as well as the dress and bodies
of cultists themselves. These symbols might be
broadly understandable, or they might have meaning
only to cultists. Roll twice on or choose results
from the Cult Symbols table to inspire a cult's icons.
Curr Mnunnns
Cults often form hierarchies around a charismatic
or domineering leader. While cult members might
work independently, they take their orders from superiors
with greater supernatural powers. Any cult
might have the following sorts of members.
Currrsr
Cultists devote themselves to their faith's leaders
and otherworldly masters. While this zeal grants
cultists no magical powers, it gives them remarkable
resolve in the face of threats. Cultists perform much
of a cult's mundane work, which might include
evangelism, criminal acts, or serving as sacrifices.
Currrsr FaN,q.rrc
Cultist fanatics lead small cults or cells within
larger cults. They're privy to more of a cult's mysteries
than lower-ranking cultists are, granting
them access to magical powers from their patrons.
Currrsr HrrnopnlNr
Cultist hierophants are leaders who oversee the
lives oftheir underlings, dictate the edicts ofthe
cult, and interpret their patron's will. They possess
supernatural powers gained from the cult's patron,
supernatural sources, or the power of their own
fanaticism. These leaders know their cult's deepest
secrets and often control strange relics, mystical
sites, and monstrous servants.

Treasure: lmplements
Genies of minerals and gemstones, dao embody
the resolve of rock. Using innate magic, they move
through the earth unimpeded, exploring depths
inaccessible to most. Dao delight in the treasures of
the earth, whether raw gemstones, jewelry crafted
from pure metals, or wondrous fossils. In exchange
for such treasures, dao might reveal underground
mysteries, such as paths through the Underdark,
buried ruins, or whole subterranean realms.
Many dao call the Elemental Plane of Earth home.
There, they create cities that glitter with treasure.
Among these realms is the labyrinthine expanse
called the Great Dismal Delve or the Sevenfold
Mazework, which protects the City of Jewels, the
Iron Crucible, and the Strait of Magnets.

Habitat Underdark; Treasure: None
Unnatural subterranean hunters, darkmantles
veil themselves in magical shadows and use their
bizarre anatomies to disguise themselves as stalactites.
When prey passes below, lurking darkmantles
drop and unfurl their webbed tentacles, attempting
to blind, suffocate, or crush their victims.
Darkmantles share similarities with piercers and
ropers and often hunt near those monsters. Scholars
have attempted to establish a shared origin or life
cycle between those creatures, but their efforts are
thwarted by those monsters' supernatural physiologies
and deadly natures.

Two-Headed Spreader of Disease
Habitau Desert; Treasure: None
Death dogs are plagues on the arid lands they inhabit.
These vicious, two-headed canines ambush
creatures they perceive as weaker than themselves,
favoring the wounded or infirm. They attack recklessly,
infecting as many creatures as possible with
their diseased jaws. If driven off, death dogs linger
close to their victims, letting infection weaken their
prey before they attack again.
Legends tie death dogs to malicious death gods,
the underworld, and cursed rulers. These stories are
based on the malady death dogs spread. Roll on or
choose a result from the Death Dog Malady Symptoms
table to inspire symptoms spread by a death
dog's bite. These symptoms are cosmetic and don't
alter the effects of the death dog's Bite action. The
symptoms vanish when a creature no longer has the
Poisoned condition from a death dog's Bite.
Dearx Doc MlllDY SYMPToMS
1d5 The Death Dog's Malady Causes ...
I Marks from canine jaws to appear on the victim's
body, as if they were still being mauled.
2 The victim's body to wither, as if constantly
exposed to desert heat.
3 The victim to be distracted by distant howling
or vague whispers only they can hear.
4 The victim's flesh to rot like a corpse.
5 The victim to itch, as if they had fleas or sand
beneath their skin.
6 Wicked symbols to gradually appear on and
spread across the victim's body.

Champions of evil, death knights are armor-clad,

lead unholy legions against the living or brood
in cursed citadels. Every death knight is haunted
by a legacy of tragedy and dishonor that drives it to
commit greater evils.

Death knights are deadly combatants and domineering
commanders with grim histories. Some
strive to end the curses that doom them to undeath,
Delrn Kn rc xr
though their selfish souls eternally shackle them to
their fates. Others, like the infamous death knight
Lord Soth, brood in dismal ruins for centuries,
rousing themselves to action only when something
reignites their deathless evil.

When the leader of a villainous order rises as a
death knight, their wicked devotees might join them

Beholder beyond Death
Habitat Underdark; Treasure: Any
A death tyrant is a beholder that pursues aberrant
goals beyond its death. Ten magical singularities-all
that remains of its magical eyes-orbit its floating,
cyclopean skull, while the hateful gaze of its central
eye socket stifles life and raises the dead.
Beholders typically transform into death tyrants
over years when their dreams fixate on death, morbid
apotheoses, or journeys to realms inhospitable
to life. Some death tyrants rise from the corpses of
slain beholders or result from exposure to strange
magic or Underdark radiation. Sometimes beholders
purposefully pursue this undead state,just as
depraved magic-users pursue lichdom, although it is
rare, as most beholders already believe themselves
to be perfect beings.
No matter how death tyrants come into being,
bizarre impulses drive their deathless existences.
Their motivations tend to be extreme or beyond the
reason of living creatures.

DnarH TYneNr Larns
Death tyrants often lurk deep in the Underdark, in
the tunnel-mazes they occupied in life or in the lairs
ofenemy beholders they conquered. These lairs are
devoid of life, as death tyrants change their servants
into Undead horrors.
The region containing a death tyrant's lair is
warped by its presence, creating the following
effects:
Negative Energy Suffusion. Whenever a creature
within 1 mile of the lair regains Hit Points from
a spell, it subtracts ldlo from the number of Hit
Points regained.
Scopophobia. Creatures within 1 mile of the lair
feel as if they're being watched. Any creature
(excluding the death tyrant and its allies) that
finishes a Short Rest while within 1 mile of the lair
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
gain no benefit from that rest.
If the death tyrant dies or moves its lair elsewhere,
these effects end immediately.

What Lies beyond Lichdom
Habitat Any; Treasure: Arcana
A demilich is a skull harboring the remnants of a
lich's wicked essence. If the burden of immortality
overwhelms a lich, its consciousness turns inward
as its body rots away. But if its remains are disturbed,
a demilich rises. Demiliches usually appear
as skulls adorned with gems or arcane sigils.
DrurrrcH LArRs
Demiliches jealously guard their deathtrap{aden
sanctums. The most notorious of these is the Tomb
of Horrors, lair of the infamous Acererak.
The region containing a demilich's lair is twisted
by its presence, creating the following effects:
Enervating Domain. Whenever a creature other
than the demilich or one of its allies finishes a
Long Rest within 1 mile of the lair, the creature
must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving
throw or have its Hit Point maximum reduced by
1d4. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes
a Long Rest outside that area.
Travel Ward. Creatures can't use teleportation or
planar travel to enter or exit the lair.
If the demilich dies or moves its lair elsewhere,
these effects end immediately.

World- Changing Angelic Me ss e nge r
Habitat: Planar (Upper Planes); Treasure: Relics
Devas are emissaries of divine will. These immortal
messengers adopt the shapes of mystical beasts or
idealized, winged mortals. As with all angels, their
true forms are known only to the gods they serve.
Rather than literal correspondence from a god, a
deva conveys an allegory or quest to mortals, tasking
them with delivering something to its rightful
place. While the angel might be called on in times of
need, it encourages mortal heroism. Should a deva's
chosen champions carry out their charge, they experience
a revelation or the world is changed in line
with divine purpose. Roll on or choose a result from
the Deva Messages table to inspire a deva's charge.

A displacer beast resembles a gaunt, six{egged panther
with a barbed tentacle sprouting from each of
its shoulders. This predator uses innate magic to
displace light so it appears to be several feet away
from its actual location.
Displacer beasts hunt notjust to feed but because
they enjoy killing. Once displacer beasts begin
stalking prey, they can't be deterred until either
they or their quarry is slain. While displacer beasts
commonly inhabit dense forests, they might pursue
travelers across great distances and even into cities
or dungeons. More cunning than mere animals,
these predators might set ambushes or lie hidden for
days to bring down their prey.
Displacer beasts sometimes pursue prey through
portals to other planes of existence. As a result,
these predators can be found across the multiverse,
particularly on the worlds of the Material Plane, in
the Shadowfell, and in the Feywild. These restless
hunters can destroy a land's natural balance and
drive other creatures to extinction. As a result,
many druid circles and Fey view displacer beasts as
deadly threats.

Draconic Tyrant Reborn
Habitat Any; Treasure Any
The vilest dragons seek to escape the grip ofdeath,
employing ageless secrets and blasphemous magic
to become horrors called dracoliches. These deathless
dragons bind their spirits to gems and magically
animate their rotting corpses. Eventually
becoming skeletal horrors, dracoliches continue the
centuries-spanning plots they pursued in life, seek
revenge on those that brought them low, and strive
toward vicious goals they couldn't indulge in life.
Dracoliches combine the corrupt immortality of
the undead with the legendary power of dragons. A
dracolich retains a breath weapon, but it is a chilling
necrotic blast. These terrors gradually sicken the
land near their lairs and attract sinister followersusually
other undead or cultists seeking to revel
in their terrible might. Living dragons of all types
loathe and seek to destroy dracoliches, viewing
them as distortions of draconic magic.
There are untold profane routes by which a
dragon might become a dracolich. However one is
created, a dracolich chooses a gem that becomes the
anchor for its spirit and binds the deathless dragon
to the world. So long as a dracolich is on the same
plane of existence as its soul gem, the dracolich
can survive the destruction of its physical body. Its
spirit retreats into the gem ifthe dracolich's body is
destroyed, and the monster might one day regain its
terrifying form. Dracoliches often sequester their
soul gems within meaningful treasure from their
hoard or in unassuming baubles. Roll on or choose a
result from the Dracolich Soul Gem Vessels table to
inspire what holds a dracolich's soul gem.

Dragon turtles are mighty creatures with shells
Iarge enough to be mistaken for islands and jaws
capable of snapping ships like twigs. While some of
these aquatic dragons contentedly slumber in the
depths, others jealously guard vast territories with
their scalding breath and lay claim to anything that
sinks into the depths or sails on the waves. Occasionally
these dragons agree to aid pirates, aquatic
peoples, or oceanic religions in return for contributions
to their sunken treasure hoards.
Many dragon turtles live in secluded lairs or ruins
deep underwater, and they might not be spotted by
surface dwellers for generations. Like both their
namesakes, dragon turtles can have exceptionally
long lives. Some recall the wonders of ages past or
remarkable individuals that passed through their
realms long ago. Such dragon turtles might be
convinced to share their tales or provide guidance
through their territories in exchange for treasures
they've never glimpsed on the ocean floor.

They are erratic, filthy, and violent, and they
demonstrate little sense of self-preservation.
Swenu oF DRETCHES
Swarms of dretches sometimes escape the Abyss
onto other planes of existence, or they might be
part of a demonic invasion. Without direction,
these crude demons rampage and despoil with cruel
enthusiasm.

Habitat: Forest, U nderdark; Treasure: Armaments
Driders combine the features of drow and giant spiders.
The wicked god Lolth is fond of transforming
her drow worshipers into driders, as either a blessing
or a curse. These driders often become fanatical
servants of their god, or they are overwhelmed by
their transformation and live only to indulge their
predatory arachnid instincts.
Driders also appear when whole communities
are transformed by a wicked god's wrath or other
magical means, or driders might be part of a world's
natural population. Most dwell underground or in
dense forests where they can make the most of their
spiderlike traits. Driders with non-drow features

from tree to tree and from root to bough, harrying
trespassers with tangling vines and thorns. Most of
these elusive beings have a special connection with
one plant or a natural sanctuary that they protect.
Some also share physical similarities with the plants
they're most connected to. Dryads might sicken or

Primal spirits from the Elemental Plane of Earth
merge with rocks and minerals to form earth elementals.
These beings possess powerful limbs and
coarse features, sometimes studded with ore, gems,
crystals, colorful striations, or living plants. On
the Material Plane, earth elementals often serve
those who conjure them, or they appear in regions
influenced by their home plane, such as crystalline
nodes, energetic fault lines, or veins of magical ore.
Earth elementals effortlessly move through stone
and can bring ruin to whole structures with their
mighty fists.
Earth elementals are typically made of more
than dirt. While an elemental's composition doesn't
change its statistics or have monetary value, it
makes each elemental distinct. Roll on or choose a

Efreet burn with the energy and unpredictability

flames from nothing and shape treasures within
magical infernos. Many efreet have wicked reputations,

might aid mortals in exchange for treasures or

The End and Beginning of Ages
Habitat Planar (Elemental Chaos); Treasure: None
Beyond the fringes of the Elemental Planes, primordial
forces endlessly clash amid the Elemental
Chaos. Within the vastness and violence of this
realm rage elemental cataclysms, entities spawned
from the raw forces of the multiverse and awash in
dissonant elemental powers. These beings of primal
conflict annihilate nearly all they encounter and
seed the ruins left in their wake with the potential
for new creations.
Elemental cataclysms rarely escape the Elemental
Chaos. When they do, it is typically due to some
planar disruption or the summons of nihilistic cultists.
When they emerge on Material Plane worlds,
elemental cataclysms create realm-altering trails of
destruction, carelessly destroying cities and throwing
whole nations into chaos. The rampages aren't
random. Elemental cataclysms abhor anything that
visibly mars nature, be it mines or monuments,
fortresses or cities, but they vent their most intense
rage on works of metal and clockwork. As they sow
destruction, they howl condemnation and chant
words of unmaking in the languages of the Inner
Planes.
Little can stop an elemental cataclysm. Those that
oppose one of these calamities often attempt to reverse
the ritual that summoned it, coax it through
a planar rift, or conjure another titan in hopes that
the two destroy one another. These terrors leave
a wake of ashes, floods, storms, and broken earth.
But after these disasters recede, the land is imbued
with new life or environmental changes. Roll on or
choose a result from the Elemental Alterations table
to inspire what changes emerge after an elemental
cataclysm's destruction.

Empyreans are the spawn of deities. While not
gods themselves, they possess divine influence and
powers related to their divine parents. Some empyreans
are near-demigods with fantastic might and
the power to reshape mortal lives. Others are little
more than divine thoughts or moments of immortal
attention made manifest. Whether empyreans are
idealized beings or vestiges of divinity, their appearances
are influenced by their creators. Roll on or

Empyrean iotas are the thoughts, memories, or indirect
attentions of deities personified and given a
measure of autonomy. Resembling floating glyphs,
motes of color, icons of divinity, or stranger shapes,
these beings are messengers ofthe gods and aides
to those gods'servants. Iotas have their own knowledge
and personalities, though they might know
little more than the realms and wishes of their
creators.
EupvnneN
Inheritors of divine might, empyreans are idealized,
human-shaped beings of godly power. These beings
might have relationships with their creators akin
to those of parents and their children, royalty and
their servants, inventors and their creations, or
other bonds. Empyreans' existences are fundamentally
influenced by their patrons and their connection
to the heavenly deities of the Upper Planes or
the fiendish deities of the Lower Planes. Nevertheless,
empyreans have free will.
Celestial empyreans are typically noble beings
who quest to prove themselves worthy of their
divine pedigree. Many work in the service of
their parents or support those gods' causes and
champions.
Fiendish empyreans are usually dreadful,
selFserving villains who seek to claim their parents'
power. Some forge unholy armies or rule over hidden
realms in mockery of true gods, while others
might seek to escape their accursed families.

Devil of Vengeance and Righteous Wrath
Habitah Planar (Nine Hells); Treasure: Armaments
Erinyes, also known as furies, are winged devils
clad in fiendish armor. These fallen angels exact a
merciless form of divine justice, hunting down oath
breakers and dragging the rightfully damned to the
Nine Hells in the grip of their magical ropes. Few
ever glimpse what lies within these devils' armored
exteriors, and erinyes ensure that those who do can
never speak of what they've seen.
Erinyes often serve archdevils and guard the order
ofthe Nine Hells against trespassers and escapees.
Although they're prone to wrathful outbursts,
erinyes cooperate well with other devils. They
sometimes hunt in trios with other erinyes, forging
infamous reputations for themselves.
When not in the service of a diabolical master,
erinyes hunt wicked souls. They pursue quarries
relentlessly, across the multiverse and for ages if
need be. While they might be summoned to serve
evil magic-users, erinyes also listen for oaths and
curses sworn in their names. In rare cases, wronged
mortals who call out with just rage might be heard
by an erinyes who appears to take vengeance on
their behalf. Once erinyes are so summoned, they
won't leave without claiming the soul of either their
quarry or the mortal who summoned them.

Venomous Arachnid Abductor
Habitat: Forest; Treasure: I mplements
Spiderlike hunters, ettercaps lurk in forested depths
and seek prey to drag into their web-choked lairs.
These vicious predators have arachnid features and
hunched, bipedal frames, and they're notorious for
their venomous bites and ability to shoot out webs
to entrap their victims. Ettercaps often hunt in
small groups alongside giant spiders and mundane
spider swarms.
Ettercaps frequently overhunt their environment.
Left unchecked, ettercaps might fill whole woodlands
with their webs and the cocooned remains
of past meals, which puts ettercaps in conflict with
Fey. Spiteful ettercaps go out oftheir way to torment
and feed on Fey; they prefer to menace those
smaller than themselves, like pixies and sprites.
They rarely devour other sapient creatures swiftly,
preferring to cocoon their captives and terrorize
them for days.
Ettercaps avoid fire, which can quickly burn
through their webs and the dead trees where they
make their homes.

Ettins are physically powerful Giants with two

to hill giants, others have more bestial or unusual
traits, such as tusks, short horns, or a single eye on
each head.
Ettins frequently ally with other Giants or groups

to the lands they inhabit, and they might know or
guard secrets valued by druids or Fey.
Each ettin head has a distinct personality. While

Giant of the Smoldering Depths
Habital M ountai n, U nderdark; Treasure: Armaments
Fire giants inhabit the hollow vaults and molten
rivers of mountainous depths. There, they use subterranean
heat and riches to craft wonders, from
titanic weapons of war to delicate works of art.
Fire giants have broad frames, skin tones in a variety
of rocklike shades, and hair like flame.
Most fire giants dwell in volcanically active
mountains or cavernous depths that house their
fortress-forges. Evil fire giants tend to be martially
minded, and they craft mighty arms to conquer
their neighbors and seize valuable resources. More
temperate fire giants trade their works for what
they need, and they might share the ancient techniques
of Giant artisans with other craftspeople.
In either case, fire giants are prone to undertaking
ambitious designs, and they rarely appreciate interruptions
in their titanic workshops.

magic-users who were reanimated by sinister necromancers
or whose magical pursuits drive them

Habitat Any; Treasure: Arcana
Flesh golems are roughly human-shaped collections
of body parts bound together by misused magic or
strange science. They serve their reckless creators,
but many possess disjointed memories and instincts
from their component parts. If wounded, these golems
might go berserk and vent their confusion on
anything in their sight, including their creators.
Flesh golems appear in varied forms. Roll on or
choose a result from the Flesh Golem Characteristics
table to inspire a flesh golem's features.

Bizarre creatures with aberrant agendas inhabit the

are helpful to strangers.
These tentacled, telepathic creatures jet through
the air in short bursts, venting gases with a sound
that gives them their name. Rather than speaking,
flumphs communicate telepathically and by changing
color to reflect their moods.
Flumphs dwell in psychically charged regions or
near creatures with psionic magic. They harmlessly
feed off psychic energies, but in doing so, they often
encounter dangerous beings such as aboleths and
mind flayers. While flumphs generally avoid combat,
they often help adventurers in peril. Such help
might be of doubtful use, but flumphs mean well.

Cursed Giant of the Dark
Habitat Underdark; Treasure: Any
Once infamous for their magical aptitude, fomorians
are giants afflicted with a fey curse. In their
pride, they were tricked into invading the Feywild
to claim its magic for their own. When the
archfey rulers of that realm united, the fomorians
were turned back and cursed with supernatural
strangeness to make their bodies match their vile
souls. Ever since, fomorians have dwelled in the
Underdark amid the ruins of their magical cities.
The archfey's curse afflicts them still, tormenting
them with wandering cankers, lurching organs, and
stranger discomforts. Rather than atoning for their
offenses, fomorians harness the magic of their curse
and turn it against others. Roll on or choose a result
from the Fomorian Warping table to inspire the
cosmetic effects a creature undergoes while they're
affected by a fomorian's Warping Hex.

Giant of the lce and Snow
Habitat Arctic, M o u nta i n ; Treasure: Arm a m ents
From glacial mountain heights and vast tundras rise
the homes of frost giants. These giants have skin
and hair of icy hues. Their natural immunity to cold
allows them to flourish in places inhospitable to
most other creatures. They use this resilience to aid
them when hunting and in combat, bolstering their
allies with chilling war cries.
Frost giants often travel far to find food and
goods. This leads many to become raiders and earn
violent reputations. Others live more peaceably by
hunting titanic game or creating sanctuaries from
the cold (frequently featuring hot springs or snowy
contests). Frost giants sometimes forge partnerships
with icy Fey or fire giants dwelling underground,
serving as guardians to their realms in exchange for
treasure, weapons, and crafts.

duhr slam into foes and animate nearby boulders to

Some mountain dwellers view galeb duhr as aloof

secrets or treasures for future generations. Others
speak of galeb duhr songs, barely audible harmonizations
by groups of galeb duhr that are said to
influence earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

Gargoyles are sculptures inhabited by elemental
spirits. Wings and magic allow their heavy stone
bodies to fly, and they often perch where they can
blend in amid ornate architecture, rock formations,
or mundane statues. Gargoyles usually serve the
magic-users who conjured them into their bodies,
but if left to their own devices, they might play cruel
pranks and steal treasures to hoard in lofty lairs.
Gargoyles have a variety of appearances. Roll on

Lost Sou/ and Unquiet Spirit
Habitat: Underdark, Urban; Treasure: Any
Ghosts arise when living creatures die in a state of
extreme emotion or having left an important task
undone. These incorporeal spirits haunt locations
that are meaningful to them, lingering until their
business is complete or they're put to rest.
Ghosts typically appear as semitransparent versions
of the creatures they were in life, though some
bear evidence of the wounds that killed them or
have nightmarish distortions to their forms. Many
have extreme reactions to actions, objects, or individuals
that remind them of emotionally charged
aspects oftheir lives. Particularly desperate or
vengeful ghosts might possess the living to fulfill
their ends.

leader named Zerthimon challenged her. Zerthimon
claimed Gith's drive for vengeance and new
conquests was evidence of species-wide mental
programing laid by the mind flayers, biological manipulation
that condemned her people to continued
servitude. This claim split the gith into Gith's followers,
the githyanki (meaning "followers of Gith"),
and Zerthimon's followers, the githzerai (meaning
"those who spurn Gith"), and sparked an ongoing
conflict.
When Gith perished, her adviser, Vlaakith, assumed
rule of the githyanki. Vlaakith's line has continued
to the githyanki's current ruler, Vlaakith the

Githzerai are gaunt, humanlike beings, physically
identical to githyanki. They share a history with
githyanki as creatures physically and psychically
transformed by mind flayers (see the "Githyanki"
section). Githzerai know that in body and mind,
their species was manipulated by their former il-
Iithid oppressors. Rather than giving in to this programming,
githzerai follow the teachings of their
first leader, Zerthimon, and reshape their minds and
bodies to find peace.
Githzerai psychically create serene, hidden sanctuaries
in chaotic reaches of the multiverse. Most
ofthese redoubts drift through the chaotic plane of
Limbo, but githzerai conclaves can also be found in
the Abyss, the Elemental Chaos, and the Feywild.
Githzerai create these cloisters to hone their psionic
abilities, to gain insights from the multiverse, and to
avoid githyanki and mind flayers.

Githzerai zerths embody the discipline espoused by

Glabrezus embody delusion and predatory guile.
These cunning demons know the most effective
traps are those that individuals devise for themselves.
Despite having massive claws and overwhelming
physicality, glabrezus excel at using
flattery and misdirection to coerce victims into isolating
themselves and harming others.
In the Abyss, glabrezus act as lone hunters or
deceitful advisers to greater demons. Glabrezus
seek routes to the Material Plane and relish being
summoned by magic-users. They eagerly serve mortals
while tempting them to betray their allies and
indulge in hubristic fantasies. A glabrezu strives to
murder its summoner once the magic-user has committed
irredeemable misdeeds and the mortal's soul
is surely condemned to the Abyss.

The first gnolls arose from hyenas that fed on flesh
tainted by the Abyss. Their corruption and violence
delighted the demon lord Yeenoghu, who encouraged
their numbers and spread them across the
multiverse. Ever since, gnolls have been the cackling
servants ofYeenoghu, existing to cause ruin and to
feast on what remains.
GNorr'W-ennron
Gnoll warriors crave endless slaughter but quickly
grow bored with the prey they kill and the treasures
they plunder. Nevertheless, they're enraged
by the thought of anyone else having what's theirs,
compelling them to despoil what they can't take
with them.
GNorr Pncr Lono
Rising above other gnolls with their viciousness and
physical prowess, gnoll pack lords terrorize weaker
gnolls into their service. These brutes drive other
gnolls to acts ofgreat violence, then claim the best
of their servants' spoils.

Gnoll demoniacs are berserkers that arise from
gnolls who've ritualistically fed on flesh corrupted

Goblins are Feywild embodiments of recklessness
and ruin. They delight in wreckage-the louder, the
more energetic, and the more convoluted, the better.
Goblin raids are often as much opportunities to
enjoy setting fires and tormenting livestock as they
are parts of more disruptive plots.
Goblins obey those who accomplish the wildest
plans. Such leaders might be goblin raid masterminds,
bombastic magic-users, or those capable of
making the loudest noises. Hobgoblins and forceful
humanoids might also command ornery groups of
goblins, directing their destructiveness toward banditry,
sabotage, or war.
The deity Maglubiyet claims to be the god of
goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, and on the Infinite
Battlefield of Acheron, the deity commands
innumerable goblinoid legions. In ages long past,
Maglubiyet witnessed the destructive propensity of
goblinoids and relocated a population of them from
the Feywild to his realm on the Outer Planes. Since
then, hordes of these more martial-minded goblins
have flourished, with some finding their ways to
Material Plane worlds. These vicious invaders seek
to sow ruin in preparation for their god's conquest.

Goblin warriors excel at causing mischief. Those in

are likely to withdraw to set up ambushes.

Goblin bosses are often the most imaginative, disruptive,
or forceful goblins. Through a combination
of luck, cowardice, and callousness, these leaders
avoid harm at the expense of their followers.

Young gold dragons have seen glimpses of the
world's true evils and crusade to oppose them. They
often seek bold and direct solutions to problems.

Adult gold dragons act subtly, frequently changing
their shape to resemble harmless animals or cultivating

Ancient gold dragons are wise and mysterious.
Many aid virtuous groups, guiding them in secret
or patronizing them from afar. Only when stakes
are at their highest do ancient gold dragons reveal
themselves in all their majesty.

Goro DnacoN Lerns
Gold dragons make their homes in places of natural
and magical wonder.
The region containing an adult or ancient gold
dragon's lair is altered by its presence, creating the
following effects:
Dream Messenger. While in its lair, the dragon can
cast Dream, requiring no Material components
and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability.
When casting the spell this way, the dragon can
target any creature within 6 miles.
Foretelling Fog. The area within l mile of the lair is
Lightly Obscured by opalescent fog. While in that
area, creatures can't be surprised, as the fog swirls
into shapes that warn of danger.
If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these
effects end immediately.

Bull,like Guardians with Petrifuing Breath
Habitat Forest, Grassland, Hill; Treasure: Any
Resembling mighty bulls armored in iron plates,
gorgons are lifelike automatons that seek to destroy
all who enter their territories. In addition to goring
foes with their deadly horns and trampling them
under their iron hooves, gorgons exhale gouts of
noxious gas.
Gorgons are created by magic-users to serve as
guardians. The process for creating a gorgon is
labor intensive and dangerous, with one method
requiring the skeleton of a bull, the blood of a medusa,
and the brain of a basilisk fused into a frame
ofensorcelled iron. Ifthe process fails, petrifying
gas emerges from the materials, creating a magical
threat that can fill a structure and linger for years.
When magic-users create gorgons, they often
enchant them to ignore those who confront the
creature with a specific command key, usually a
password or a specific signal. Once a gorgon is set

to guard an area, it attacks any who enter until they
flee or are destroyed. Should someone provide the
command key, the monster ignores that intruder
so long as the intruder remains in its sight. But if
the intruder ventures out of sight and then returns
without again presenting the command key, the
gorgon attacks. Those in a gorgon's territory must
remain vigilant and aware of the monster's exact
position, or they risk being attacked by a gorgon
they thought was no longer a threat.
Those who create gorgons strive to give them
purposefully obscure command keys. Hints at
command keys might be found among the records
of a gorgon's creator or in the area the gorgon protects-
perhaps scrawled as a petrified trespasser's
final act. Roll on or choose a result from the Gorgon
Command Keys table to inspire the word or signal
that temporarily neutralizes a gorgon.

G_o*ry_cgry
Most gorgons are iron bulls wreathed in clouds of
petrifying gas. Their metal plates vary in sheen and
color, from sleek silver to pitted black. The oldest
gorgons might be covered in rust, but this rarely
impedes their abilities. These gorgons' stomping
grounds are littered with the shattered remains of
petrified foes. Many gorgons outlive their creators
by centuries, misleading some to believe these creations
have natural origins and territories. Most
such gorgons continue to follow age-old commands,
guarding sites long fallen to ruin.
BneznN Go_ncory
Followers of the exiled archdevil Moloch altered the
process of creating gorgons to craft their own diabolical
guardians called brazen gorgons. These gorgons
are hollow, bull-like automatons whose metal
bodies glow with intense heat. When they charge
their foes, the ribs of their frames open like cages to
ensnare enemies and roast them within. Brazen gorgons
are often found in blasphemous sites dedicated
to Moloch, other archdevils, or bloodthirsty gods.

Terrifying in scale and overwhelming power, goristros
are giant demons capable of bringing cities to
ruin. These demons embody senseless anarchy and
nihilistic destruction, and they take special offense
at creatures or structures that rival them in size.
Castles, towers, giants, and beasts of war are all
common victims of these monsters'wrath.
Goristros resemble hunched, primeval minotaurs
bearing the scars of Abyssal wars or wounds from
mighty war machines. Their appearance reflects
that of their creator, Baphomet, the demon lord
worshiped by many evil minotaurs. Goristros stalk
Baphomet's Abyssal realm, known as the Endless
Maze, and pulp any non-demons they encounter in
that massive, magical labyrinth.

Dragons of Deceit and Derision
Habitat Forest; Treasure: Arcana
From forbidden forest depths, green dragons whisper
evils into the world and manipulate the lives of
those who listen. Elusive, conniving, and egotistical,
these chromatic dragons patiently prey on the fears
of shorter{ived beings, corrupting and isolating
them. Green dragons might lurk amid labyrinthine
wildernesses for centuries without revealing themselves;
even their most devoted followers might
know them only as the voice of the woodlands or a
whisper in their dreams.
Despite their might, most green dragons disdain
physical violence, viewing combat as servants'work
and preferring to trick foes into dangerous or exploitative
scenarios. These dragons collect "baubles"
that embody their webs of manipulation and serve
as tools of extortion, such as compromising documents,
family heirlooms, and sentimental treasures.
GnnnN DnecoN'W.ynurrNc
Green dragon wyrmlings often serve as pawns in
older dragons' schemes. By spying on those dragons'
agents, wyrmlings learn the art of manipulation.
Once they've accumulated influence and lackeys,
these wyrmlings depart to claim their own territories
and pursue their sinister ambitions.
YouNc GnnrN DnecoN
Young green dragons frequently control groups of
ettercaps, kobolds, thieves, or other cowardly servants.
These dragons do so while avoiding other evil
dragons, who would sabotage them. Gradually, oppressing
weaker creatures and amassing meaningless
fortunes bore young green dragons, and they
pursue more ambitious ways to indulge their egos.

A»urr GnnnN DnecoN
The words ofadult green dragons are as deadly as
their poisonous breath. They are brilliant schemers
that pride themselves on influencing communities
near their lairs. They obsess over information and
create vast spy networks. Many of these dragons
seek magical methods of surveillance or domination,
and they manipulate adventurers into hunting
down lost magic to aid in such control.
ANcrnNr GnnrN DnecoN
Ancient green dragons are creatures of legend,
rarely seen by their servants or foes. Via magic and
well-hidden agents, these dragons stoke suspicion
between allies and undermine noble works. As
bonds fray, the dragons reap rewards ofgreater
wealth and control. Eventually the ambitions of ancient
green dragons stretch beyond their territories
as they seek control over empires, planar realms, or
death itself.
Ancreur Gnerru Dnnconr
G3rnN D34co-1y*!4rRq
Green dragons lair in ancient forests, often shaping
stands of massive trees into compounds of interwoven
branches, hollow trunks, and caverns amid
mighty roots. They might also dwell amid forested
ruins, particularly the former homes of those
they've conquered.
The region containing an adult or ancient green
dragon's lair is warped by its presence, creating the
following effects:
Beast Spies. Tiny Beasts magically gain the ability
to understand Draconic and can communicate
telepathically with the dragon while within I mile
of the lair.
Poisonous Thicket. Ordinary plants growing
within I mile of the lair poison the air around
them. Whenever a creature other than the dragon
or its allies finishes a Long Rest in that area, it
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or have the Poisoned condition for I hour.
If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these
effects end immediately.

FoulWitch of the WickedWild
Habitat: Forest, Hill, Swamp; Treasure: Arcana
Green hags work bitter magic to foul all that is
beautiful and pure. Whether alone or in covens
of other hags, these ancient witches call on eerie
forces, spreading corruption and plotting doom for
those who earn their ire. Green hags are adept deceivers,
and they use illusions to cloak themselves in
unassuming forms, hoping to tempt innocents into
peril. These hags often spirit their victims back to
surreal lairs where they hold captives prisoner or
cook them into monstrous meals.
Green hags frequently know strange magic or forgotten
secrets, such as the weaknesses ofvillains,
the locations of lost treasures, or the ways to break
curses. They might trade such knowledge for rare
magic or symbolic treasures. Roll on or choose a
result from the Green Hag Bargains table to inspire
what a green hag charges for its secrets.

Bizarre Hunter That Travels between Worlds
Habitat: U nderdark; Treasure: None
With barbed tentacles sprouting from their
brain-shaped bodies, grells hunt the lightless
depths. These silent predators defy gravity, allowing
them to strike from unexpected places,
and they perceive their surroundings via sound
and electrical fields. Their tentacles secrete paralytic
venom, which prevents most creatures
ambushed by grells from crying out before being
dragged into the dark and consumed.
Grells are sapient beings, but their intellects
and motivations are alien to most. They typically
cooperate with one another only to defeat more
powerful prey. Most demonstrate no interest in
creating things or in communicating with other
creatures, including their own kind.
Many grells pursue methods of traveling between
worlds and planes of existence. They

Worms That Hunt the Dark and Decaying
Habitau Forest, Underdark; Treasure: Any
Gricks are wormlike predators that burst from hiding-
flailing and snapping-to consume whatever
prey passes near. They hide in cavernous crags or
amid deadfalls, the scattered bones and possessions
of past meals the only evidence of their threat.
Gricks'origins are unclear, but some suggest these
creatures arise from natural worms or similar invertebrates
mutated by magical phenomena. Many
cite the presence of gricks in a region as evidence
of portals to other planes of existence, legendary
magic items, or powerful supernatural beings.
Gnrcr
Gricks tend to be solitary hunters, but young gricks
might lurk near dozens of their brood mates for
years before gradually drifting apart.
Gnrcr ANcrBNt
Gricks can live for centuries, with the eldest growing
to monstrous sizes. Grick ancients actively hunt
more than they wait in ambush, and they have no
qualms about devouring smaller gricks.

Puppet of the Mind Flayer Menace
Habitat Underdark; Treasure: Any
Grimlocks are victims of biological manipulation
by mind flayers. To create grimlocks, illithids capture
Humanoids, expose them to strange forms of
Underdark radiation, and implant new directives
into their brains. The process of creating a grimlock
rends the creature's mind such that no semblance of
the individual's former personality remains.
Grimlocks have shallow depressions rather than
eyes. A sixth sense allows grimlocks to perceive
their surroundings. Psychic energies from their
transformations linger in grimlocks' bodies, and
they channel these eerie forces into their attacks.

training. They might be bouncers, lookouts, members
of a city watch, or other keen-eyed warriors.

Guard captains often have ample professional experience.
They might be accomplished bodyguards,
protectors of magic treasures, veteran watch members,
or similar wardens.

Born through magical rites involving the essences
of dragons, half-dragons serve their creators and
their own draconic whims. Most half-dragons are
created by chromatic dragons who desire servants
with some trace of their own might and grandeur.
Half-dragons frequently command other servants
of a villainous dragon or act as agents in lands
where their draconic master would attract unwanted
attention.
Half-dragons share personality traits and agendas
with the dragon who spawned them. Those resembling
chromatic dragons typically loathe their creator
even as they seek the same ends.*IalFdragons
with the traits of metallic dragons are especially
rare, but they might arise through magical accidents,
the efforts of reckless magic-users, or the last
act of a dying dragon.

Habitat Coastal, Forest, Hill, Mountain; Treasure: Any
Hate-filled creatures, harpies strive to cause pain
and bring an end to love and life. These monsters
combine humanlike features with the talons and
wings of avian scavengers. Their notorious songs
compel listeners to follow them, heedless of danger.
Creatures captivated by a harpy's song frequently
meet their deaths on harpies'vicious claws or amid
natural perils. "
Harpies dwell in remote, dismal places tainted by
tragedy and despair. Some tales claim harpies oF
fended the gods and were transformed as a punishment;
harpies might also be the descendants of such
cursed souls.
Every harpy sings a distinct song. While some
songs are said to be heartbreaking in their beauty,
others are wretched squawking and compel only the
magically enthralled.

Spawned from the pits of Acheron, Gehenna, and
the Nine Hells, hell hounds enforce the merciless
order of those realms and the whims of tyrannical
masters. On their home planes of existence, these
grim canines ensure that souls don't escape their
bleak afterlives. On the Material Plane, hell hounds
typically serve cruel masters-such as fire giants
and cultists-who appreciate their viciousness, obedience,
and fiery characteristics. Hell hounds serve
other creatures so long as they're given opportunities
to hunt and kill, but they're quick to turn on
those who treat them as mere animals.
Hell hounds have greater cunning than normal
canines. They're skilled trackers and work together
well in packs, often employing tricks and ambushes.
Hell hounds enjoy hearing prey scream in their
scorchingjaws and fiery breath. They often go out
of their way to draw out the terror of their victims'

Demon of Obscenity andOutrage
Habitat Planar (Abyss); Treasure: Any
Hezrous compose the bulk of many demonic hordes.
In croaking, reeking throngs, these ogre-size brutes
seek to crush and consume foes. Their oozing hides
are manifestations of embodied evils. Every few
moments, patches of their slimy skins erupt with
grotesque transformations such as rows of mismatched
fangs, fungal growths, or half-formed features.
These unsettling manifestations emerge, then
roil away.
Hezrous serve more powerful demons, such as
nalfeshees and mariliths. They take the abuse and
intimidation of these deadlier demons and pass it on
to droves ofweaker dretches and manes. This predictable
brutality makes hezrous useful links in the
chaotic structure of a demonic horde.

Standing three times the size of most humans, these

including hues suggestive of the earth and mosses
near their dwellings.
Among hidden valleys, pristine waterfalls, and
game-filled slopes, hill giants usually find their
needs met by nature's bounty. What the wilderness
doesn't provide, hill giants make, crafting clothes,
tools, and weapons from rocks, wood, and hides.
When they encounter strangers, hill giants might
be suspicious and protective oftheir territories, but
some might be convinced to share their bounties
with travelers willing to entertain them.
Disaster, invasion, or want might drive hill giants
from their homes into other people's lands. Some
displaced hill giants might steal what they need or
seek revenge for their losses by causing ruin among
smaller beings. Others might take up lives of raiding

Conquerers of Every Horizon
Habitat Desert, Forest, Crassland, Hill, Mountain,
Planar (Acheron), Underdark; Treasure: Armaments,
lndividual
Hobgoblins embody the primal urge to grow and
spread, expressing such drives by bending the world
to their whims. Lone hobgoblins claim woodland
territories and plunder the wilds. In groups, they
form hierarchical, martial societies bent on conquering
lands and stripping them of resources to
serve their expansionist zeal.
Hobgoblins often subjugate animals, monsters,
and destructive Fey-particularly goblins and bugbears-
to serve their plans. Hobgoblins might ally
with dragons, warlords, the servants of warlike
gods, or other powerful creatures that promise
them control of new territories. Should hobgoblins
bring an entire land to heel, they seek new conquests,
venturing across seas, into the Underdark,
or to stars and planes of existence beyond.
Many hobgoblins serve the violent god Maglubiyet,
whose hunger for conquest matches their
own. Hobgoblin followers of Maglubiyet flourish
in the Infinite Battlefield of Acheron, where they
endlessly indulge their drive for domination. These
war-obsessed hobgoblins employ elaborate tactics
and strange weapons, which they sometimes un-
Ieash on worlds of the Material Plane.

Habitat Underdark; Treasure: None
Hook horrors are beaked predators whose forelimbs
end in massive, hooklike claws. They flourish in the
cavernous mazes of the Underdark, with its milesdeep
trenches and stalactite forests suspended over
empty darkness, where they barrel through caves
and swing across cavern ceilings.
Hook horrors feed opportunistically on plants,
fungi, and any creatures that come close enough to
hook. To perceive their surroundings, hook horrors
echolocate via a range of noises, from banging on
rocks and their own bodies to vocalizations that
sound like strange squawks, screams, or clicks. Only
hook horrors know the meaning of these noises,
but many people who explore the Underdark or live
near deep-reaching caves have sought the sources
of such sounds only to fall victim to hungry hook
horrors.

Most hydras have five heads, but some mature or

might become local legends, known for their battles
with heroes or for the riches lost in their domains.

Devil of Antipathy and lntellectual Arrogance
Habital Planar (Nine Hells); Treasure: Arcana
Heartless strategists of the Nine Hells, ice devilsalso
known as gelugons-forsake emotion to indulge
in their own malicious interpretations of logic. For
them, the multiverse is a puzzle that must be solved
to benefit them, their masters, and the Nine Hells.
Ice devils act maliciously, disguising their whims
as reason and strategy. In the service of evil masters,
these insectile devils patiently plot the movements
of infernal armies and scheme ways to fulfill
wicked goals. They might also serve as guardians,
owing to their martial prowess and ability to reshape
battlefields with walls of ice.
When indulging their own schemes, ice devils
tempt mortals to forsake empathy and social connections
to embrace selfish, destructive visions of
intellectualism. After isolating victims, these devils
drain them oftheir secrets or send them forth to
spread fractious dogmas cloaked as reason.
Ice devils usually lurk in frozen realms, particularly
the frigid layer of Cania in the Nine Hells.

Habitat Any; Treasure: None
Known for their cowardice and toadying, imps
serve devils and wicked magic-users. Their abilities

other creatures relate what they discover to
their masters, but they frequently omit important
details or cast events in the worst possible light to
mislead their masters into following the imps' devilish
council.
Imps without masters delight in manipulating
other creatures and inflating their own egos. They
might take over bands of weaker monsters, or they
might pose as helpful spirits and trick influential individuals
into pursuing nefarious ends.

Shape-Shifting Trickster of the Wilds
Habitat Desert, Crassland; Treasure: lmplements
Indistinguishable from jackals in their natural form,
jackalweres shape-shift to deceive others. These
shape-shifters can take three forms: a jackal, a human,
or a monstrous hybrid of the two. Jackalweres
are easily mistaken for werewolves, but jackalweres
aren't supernaturally afflicted-their jackal forms
are their natural state. Jackalweres also possess
magical gazes capable of putting foes to sleep, allowingjackalweres
to play their tricks unimpeded
or get the upper hand over threats.
Jackalweres dwell in inhospitable wildernesses
and pride themselves on their cleverness. They take
offense at those who travel through their lands
without leaving a gift of treasure or fresh game. Roll
on or choose a result from the Jackalwere Tricks table
to inspire how a jackalwere repays such slights.

Kenku are birdlike folk who once soared the skies
and sang enchanted songs, but a curse stole their
wings and transformed their voices. Now kenku slip
through the shadows of cities and the Shadowfell,
trying to recover what they've lost. To some, this
means seeking an end to their curse; others search
for magic or contraptions to enable them to fly and
sing again.
The curse affecting kenku allows them to vocally
communicate only by mimicking sounds they've
heard. Kenku can supernaturally re-create vast
varieties of noises, from crying babies to running
water and short phrases in others'voices. Cunning
kenku use their mimicry to deceive foes, lure creatures
into ambushes, and signal to allies.

Swamp, Underdark, Urban; Treasure: Armaments
Cowardly cousins to chromatic dragons, kobolds
serve draconic overlords as warriors and servants.
These scrappy menaces mimic the behaviors of
their dragon masters. Though their small stature
and recklessness make kobolds poor imitators of
dragons, what they lack in ferocity they make up
for in zeal and ingenuity. They are especially adept
at creating traps and setting ambushes.
Kobolds' scales resemble those of chromatic dragons
that live near their warrens. Rarely, kobolds
possess features evocative of metallic dragons or
other dragon{ike creatures.
Kosoro Wennron
Kobold warriors use hit-and-run tactics to raid their
enemies and defend their homes. To avoid danger,
they frequently employ haphazard traps.
'W'rNcn» Kosoro
Some kobolds are born with wings. Called urds by
others oftheir kind, these kobolds are thought to be
blessed by a dragon or Tiamat, the Dragon Queen.
Despite their favored status, winged kobolds are
as cowardly as their brethren and use their flight
mostly to keep out of reach of their foes.

Leviathan of Legend
Habitat Underwater; Treasure: Any
Ancient weapons of the gods, krakens slumber in
the deepest oceanic abysses, awaiting their time
to rise and dominate the world. These massive,
many-tentacled horrors combine overwhelming
physical might with formidable cunning. Their powerful
limbs shatter ships and topple spires, and they
use their control over storms to rain down lightning
on their foes.
Krakens usually have little interest in mortal
affairs. These terrors were created by the gods to
wage war in ages long forgotten. Since that era,
most krakens have vanished beneath the waves to
slumber until the gods call on them again. Some
krakens serve divine masters still, protecting deep
sea treasures or entire oceans. Others have forsaken
their divine creators and pursue their own agendas,
manipulating forces beneath the sea and beyond.
Krakens rarely appear on the surface, but when
they do, they herald times of change and doom.
When roused to action, these titans directly attack
coastal cities or whole armadas. Kraken onslaughts
persist until their wrath is sated, their divine
patrons are appeased, or their egos are placated by
valuable offerings. Roll on or choose a result from
the Kraken Attacks table to inspire what ruin a
kraken might unleash.

KnernN Lerns
Kraken lairs tend to be sunken temples, eldritch
ritual sites, or primeval places of divine power.
They might lie deep beneath bodies of fresh or
salt water, and they often connect to labyrinths of
flooded subterranean tunnels or networks of magical
portals.
The region containing a kraken's lair is twisted by
its presence, creating the following effects:
Ocean Tlrant. The kraken exerts its dominance
over animals in its domain. All Beasts within 1
mile of the lair have the Charmed condition while
in that area.
KnlxeN
Sea and Storms. While in its lair, the kraken can
cast ControlWeather, requiring no spell components
and using Intelligence as the spellcasting
ability.
If the kraken dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these
effects end immediately.

Kuo-ToA
Fishlike Fanatics of the Deep
Habitat Coastal, Underdark; Treasure: Relics
Kuo-toa have slimy, humanoid bodies and the heads
ofgoggle-eyed deep-sea fish. They claim they once
dominated whole worlds, their empires spanning
land and sea under the blessings of piscine gods.
The kuo-toa can't say what disaster brought their
glorious civilization to an end, but elves, humans,
mind flayers, and the kuo-toan gods bear the brunt
of their blame. From the lands and seas of the surface,
the kuo-toa retreated into cavernous trenches
and Underdark seas. In these hidden realms, kuotoa
brood over all they've lost and forgotten, nursing
plots to avenge themselves for slights that might
never have occurred.
Kuo-toa hate the civilizations of the surface and
the Underdark, believing themselves to be victims
of age-old slights and ongoing conspiracies. Kuo-toa
undertake contrived plots to propel themselves to
dominance, often kidnapping people to learn their
secrets or making dubious sacrifices to bizarre gods.
To facilitate such plots, kuo-toa try to capture creatures
alive using nets or strange weapons. Drow,
dwarves, and gnomes dwelling in the Underdark, as
well as surface communities near submerged subterranean
passages, are frequent targets for kuo-toa
raids and other plots.
Kuo-toa frequently serve depraved masterminds
such as aboleths and krakens. Such kuo-toa believe
these powerful creatures are avatars of kuo-toan
deities or gods in their own right. Kuo-toa might
temporarily ally with other evil creatures, but these
alliances shift as kuo-toa leaders interpret omens
from their unpredictable deities.
Kuo-roe
Kuo-toa loot ruins and raid communities near their
dwellings in the Underdark. Their shields are coated
in sticky slime, which they use to disarm their foes,
and they employ slimy nets to entrap victims. They
usually strive to take their enemies alive and drag
captives to their hidden lairs.
Most kuo-toa follow the orders of their more powerful
leaders out of a combination of faith and fear.
In rare cases, a kuo-toa might abandon its community
to live as a hermit or wanderer. Such kuo-toa
might know much about the Underdark, but they
live in fear ofthe strange gods they forsook.

Kuo-toa ever seek to placate their inscrutable
deities. However, few kuo-toa can agree on the
identities of their gods, and little consistency exists
between kuo-toa communities. Only Blibdoolpoolp
the Sea Mother, a figure with a human body but the
head and claws of a crayfish, sees broad worship.
Lacking information about what their other gods
look like, kuo-toa priests invent new forms for
them, creating divine idols with whatever objects
are at hand. But whether these kuo-toa priests draw
power from belief or delusion, aberrant talent, or a

Accursed Bargainer and Ruin Raider
Habitat Desert; Treasure: Arcana
Legends say the first lamia was an ambitious ruler
who made a sinister bargain with the demon lord
Graz'zt for everlasting majesty. As a consequence,
the ruler was transformed into a lamia, a monster
with the body of a lion and an accursed touch.
Lamias either are descendants of that first lamia
or have made similar deals. They often dwell near
ruins, seeking mysterious magic they can use to
gain riches and influence. Lamias use magical illusions
and enchantments to trick others into serving
them. They sometimes work with bandits to abduct
travelers, releasing captives only ifthey accept a
dangerous bargain. Roll on or choose a result from
the Lamia Pacts table to inspire a lamia's desires.

Fitting Fates for Depraved Souls
Habital Planar (Lower Planes); Treasure: None
Souls condemned to the Lower Planes often become
larvae-repulsive, maggot{ike creatures with
twisted features evocative of those they possessed
in life. These pathetic creatures are nearly helpless
and struggle to escape the attention ofthe more
powerful inhabitants of the Lower Planes. Many
Fiends view larvae as delicacies to be consumed,
while evil magic-users find larvae useful for depraved
rituals. Night hags frequently collect and
herd larvae, trading them to nefarious parties
across the multiverse.
Larvae that survive on the Lower Planes long
enough can eventually transform into other sorts of
lesser Fiends.
Lenve
Larvae have disjointed, painful memories of their
past lives. Most desperately avoid other creatures.
Swanvr oF LARVAE
Lone larvae pose little threat, but in large numbers,
larvae can overwhelm vulnerable creatures. Out
of desperation, larvae band together in grotesque
swarms, their squirming stampedes heralded by
a din of wordless whimpers and stomach-turning

Deathless Mqster of Magic
Habitat Any; Treasure: Arcana
Some nefarious magic-users carry out forbidden
necromantic rituals that sever their souls from
their bodies to turn themselves into liches, masters
of magic and undeath. With their souls preserved
in hidden relics, liches puppet their own corpses as
they pursue ambitions free from mortal bonds.
Liches possess exceptional cunning and magical
prowess, and they use their unnatural immortality
to pursue arcane secrets few could grasp in a single
life. Uncanny agendas lead them to plumb the
secrets of life, the multiverse, godhood, and less
fathomable topics. Careless of mortal lives or desires,
liches go to any lengths to achieve their goals.
A lich's age and origin influences its form. Older
liches appear as little more than brittle skeletons
clad in the rotten finery of forgotten empires, while
younger liches more closely resemble living creatures
and are clad in contemporary garb. Many
cloak themselves in illusions of their idealized mortal
forms.
Although liches don't fear death, they're not free
from the ravages of time. Over ages, some liches
lose their connection to time and the physical
world, degenerating into demiliches.
LrcH SunlrJens
The process of becoming a lich is involved, dangerous,
and unique to each would-be lich. If the
rite succeeds, the lich's soul is bound to a spirit jar,
a specially prepared magical repository. This relic
anchors the lich's spirit to the world and preserves
it should the lich's body be destroyed. A lich can
be slain only if its spirit jar is ruined. As such, a
lich goes to great lengths to hide and protect its
spirit jar.
Spirit jars are typically small, well-made objects
that were meaningful to a lich in life. Roll on or
choose a result from the Lich Spirit Jar table to inspire
where a lich hides its soul.

Liches create secluded libraries of magical lore and
arcane laboratories hidden within extraplanar bastions,
fortresses with cursed reputations, or other
such deadly sanctuaries.
The region containing a lich's lair is warped by its
presence, creating the following effects:
All-Seeing. While in its lail the lich can cast Clairvoyance,
requiring no spell components and using
the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting
action.
Inevitable Siphon. Whenever a Humanoid dies
within I mile of the lair, its soul is immediately
consumed by the lich. A Humanoid whose soul is
Lrcn
consumed in this way can be brought back to life
only by a True Resurrection or Wish spell.
If the lich is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere,
these effects end immediately. These effects resume
if the lich gains a new body (see its Undead Restoration

power. While some use their magic to protect the
world, others become tyrants or pursue forbidden
secrets. Many archmages retain magical servants

Magmins divide all things into two categories:
things that are on fire and things that should be on
fire. With bodies of flame and magmatic rock, these
halfling-size creatures delight in setting fires. They
do so not out of malice but out of enthusiasm for
primal fire. They don't consider that objects have
value beyond kindling or that creatures can be
harmed by flames. If such concepts are explained to
them, they find the ideas difficult to grasp and don't
remember them for long. Rather, they relish every
opportunity to set flammable things alight, delighting
in igniting paper, wooden structures, and explosives.
Magmins are dangerous even in death, since
they explode when they're destroyed, their flames
igniting combustible materials nearby.
Magmins might be conjured by magic-users to
harry foes or might escape the Elemental Plane
of Fire through portals or rifts that lead to other
realms. They're attracted to places of intense heat,
such as volcanoes and rivers of magma. If they
can't find such favored conditions, magmins eagerly
burn structures or start wildfires to entertain
themselves.

Marids surge with the power of the seas, using it to
manipulate the waves or create water. These genies
typically dwell in or near bodies of water. While
gentle marids make homes amid springs, oases,
and serene pools, tempestuous marids inhabit sea
stacks, whirlpools, and treacherous coasts. Marids
vary in appearance, their bodies reflecting the colors
of the waves while distinctive fins and scales
accent their features. Marids lend their powers
and knowledge of the seas to those who defend the
marids'watery realms or who offer them pleasing
gifts. Marids appreciate rare aquatic treasures, such
as colorful pearls, shell instruments, or delicacies
from distant seas.
Marids hail from the Elemental Plane of Water,
where they live in wondrous homes drifting amid
the endless ocean. Among these is the Citadel of
Ten Thousand Pearls-a coral sphere studded with
dozens of domed theaters and libraries-and the airfilled,
cosmopolitan City of Glass.

With their hair of living snakes and their infamous
petrifying gazes, medusas are hubristic creatures
that inhabit sites of fallen glory. They often dwell
beyond the fringes of civilization or travel in disguise,
leaving trails of petrified victims. Some medusas
dominate groups of monsters or criminals,
controlling them with threats of petrified doom,
while others recruit servants that are immune to
being petrified, such as gargoyles and gorgons.
Medusas are born or created through preternatural
circumstances. Roll on or choose a result from

Habitau Planar (Elemental Planes); Treasure: None
Mephits are mean-spirited tricksters that dwell on
the Elemental Planes. The six most prominent types
of mephits resemble halfling-size gargoyles with
wings, exaggerated features, and bodies composed
of two elements. Most live self-interested existences,
indulging their warped senses of humor or
overblown egos on their home planes of existence.
Some serve as messengers or spies for genies or
magic-users.
Mephits resent leaving the elemental extremes
where they make their homes. If loosed on the
Material Plane or other realms, they lash out with
nasty pranks or by tormenting weaker creatures.
When destroyed, mephits explode in a burst of elemental
magic.
Dusr Mnpnrr
Dust mephits are composed of air and fine earth.
They are drawn to forsaken places, and they think
everything associated with death is hilarious.
Icr MnpnIt
Ice mephits have bodies made of frigid air and
frozen water. They delight in freezing things and
dropping ice into peoples' clothes.
Mrq.c\da MnPHrr
These mephits embody the merging of earth and
fire as glowing magma. They love melting things,
but they loathe magmins and attack them on sight.
Mu» Mnpnrr
A combination of earth and water, mud mephits are
crude, disgusting creatures. They take every opportunity
to ruin objects and pollute food with muck.

Vicious aquatic hunters, merrow combine the features
of ogres with those of primeval, predatory
fish. They lurk in coastal waters, hoping to snare
unsuspecting prey by bursting from the water and
grabbing their quarry or by skewering victims with
deadly harpoons. These hunters then drag land
dwellers back to dismal undersea lairs. Merrow often
keep prisoners in their larders as future meals.
Merrow raid coastal settlements and merfolk
communities to steal weapons and treasure. This
Ieads to conflicts between merfolk and merrow, but
it also provokes misunderstandings with surface

Yugoloth of Tenacity and Want
Habitat Pla na r (Cehen na) ; Treasure: Armaments
Mezzoloths are insectile yugoloths that seek power
and souls in the service of fiendish lords. These
greedy, violent yugoloths are more direct than most
of their scheming brethren, but what they lack in
guile they make up for in persistence and numbers.
Mezzoloths typically form mercenary bands
with others of their kind. These forces serve more
powerful yugoloths, other fiends, sinister mages, or
anyone who provides them with tempting rewards.
Mezzoloths obediently adhere to the bargains they
strike, potentially serving their patrons for centuries,
but once those terms expire, yesterday's client
could become today's target. Roll on or choose a
result from the Mezzoloth Payments table to inspire
a mezzoloth's price for its services.

In their natural forms, mimics are little more than
roaming stomachs, their blobby bodies covered
with alien eyes and teeth. They can alter their color,
texture, and dimensions to duplicate inanimate
objects of their approximate size. Mimics use their
disguises as both camouflage and bait. Once victims
draw close, mimics strike, lashing out with their
sticky pseudopods and toothy mouths. After consuming
victims, mimics usually relocate, change
form, and await their next meal.

Brain-E ating U nde r dark Ty r ant s
Habitat U nderdark; Treasure: Arcana
Scattered survivors of a world-ruining, multiversal
empire, mind flayers lurk in secret conclaves hidden
deep within Material Plane worlds. Within their
alien sanctuaries, these wicked masterminds-also
known as illithids-reshape the Underdark and its
inhabitants to serve their unfathomable whims.
Mind flayers are feared for their psionic powers,
which allow them to stun and control other creatures,
and for their horrific method of feeding: using
their four slimy tentacles to extract the brains
of their victims.
Mind flayers are infamous plotters and manipulators,
concocting plans that reach beyond their
subterranean realms. Aside from using their psionic
powers to control others, mind flayers often experiment
with their own bizarre life cycles, implanting
other creatures with illithid young to create unnatural
servants. Creatures such as grimlocks and
intellect devourers result from mind flayers'biological
tampering, while other Underdark-dwelling
monsters-including kuo-toa, quaggoths, and troglodytes-
often serve i[ithid masters. Githyanki and
githzerai have a long adversarial history with mind
flayers and bear the scars of illithid manipulation.
MrNo Frevnn Corourns
Mind flayers work as lone schemers, in mysterious
cabals, or as part of worlds-spanning illithid
conspiracies. In groups, mind flayers work toward
bizarre agendas organized by an elder brain-a massive,
brain-like being with incredible psionic powers.
Without such a leader, groups of mind flayers fall
to self-destructive squabbling. Roll on or choose a
result from the Mind Flayer Machinations table to
inspire an illithid conclave's plots.

Baphomet, Demon Lord of Beasts, claims to have

While most minotaurs live free of the demon lord's

Mechanized Caretakers of Multiversal Law
Habitat Planar (Mechanus); Treasure: None
Beings of magic and machinery, modrons embody
absolute law. These inhabitants of the clockwork
plane of Mechanus tend to the incredible mechanisms
of their orderly home and oppose chaotic
forces across the multiverse.
Modrons are parts of a vast hierarchy, spanning
from quirky monodrones to the leader of their kind,
the godlike Primus. Every modron carries out tasks
assigned to it by higher-ranking modrons, doing so
without question. Generally, modrons communicate
only with other modrons of their own rank or the
ranks immediately above and below them' Those
more than one rank away tend to be either too advanced
or too simple for them to understand.
Modrons excel at tasks that require patience and
precision, but they have little understanding of nonliteral
concepts such as art or humor. They have no
egos; they have only their work and the certainty
that multiversal law depends on their efficacy.
In rare cases, a modron goes rogue and develops
its own will. In these cases, other modrons are sent
to recover or destroy their malfunctioning kin.
MoonoN Mlncnns
Whether in service to lawful deities or as part of
the Great Modron March, modrons travel from
Mechanus to spread their vision of law to other
planes ofexistence. Roll on or choose a result from
the Modron Operations table to inspire what effort
leads a group of modrons to other realms.

3 Excavate a portal to another plane.
4 Find a lost contingent of modrons.
5 Reactivate a titanic but lost modron device.
6 Remove a forest, mountain, or city before the
arrival of a modron procession.
7 Seal off a planar rift or wild magic zone.
8 Wage war with demons, slaadi, or chaotic Fey,
MoonoN MoNoonoNn
The most numerous modrons, monodrones can
perform one simple task at a time. They believe anything
they're told that isn't logically or mathematically
false. When faced with unexpected situations,
they're quick to seek duodrones for help.

Deqthless Ancients with Ageless Ambitions
Habitat Desert, Swamp; Treasure: Relics
Mysterious rites and mighty faith can tie spirits to
their corpses, binding them to their remains for all
time. Should their resting places be violated, these
beings, known as mummies, reanimate their deteriorating
bodies to restore the sanctity of their tombs
and punish those who disturbed their rest.
Mummies pursue those who offend them, typically
mortals who desecrate their resting places,
steal their burial treasures, or defile sites tied
to their faith. With undying rage, these ancient
corpses go to extreme lengths to avenge themselves
and restore what they need to find peace.
A mummy might look frail, but its body possesses
supernatural strength, and its gaze can strike fear
in the bravest hearts. Those who escape a mummy's
grasp might find themselves subject to a terrible
curse. Victims of a mummy's curse gradually
wither, their bodies rotting away until they're reduced
to dust. This curse can be healed only by the
Remove Curse spell or similar magic.
Mu_runav
Common mummies are the remains of priests, nobles,
or champions of faith that underwent magical
burial rites. Some are preserved through processes
using linen wrappings or clay, but others are preserved
by peat bogs, ice, magic, or other means.
Roll on or choose a result from the Mummy Resurrections
table to determine why a mummy has
returned from the dead.

Those desperate to escape death sometimes make
terrible bargains with wicked deities. Devoting their
hearts to evil forces, these villains gain power over
death and a cursed immortality that binds their
minds and spirits within a desiccated corpse. Freed
from mortal concerns, these mummy lords pursue
their obsessions across ages.
Most mummy lords linger amid the ruins of ancient
palaces or temples where they once held sway.
Their age-old faith and ties to deathly forces grant
them fearful magic, which they use to sow ruin and
animate undead servants.
A mummy lord's heart embodies the pact that
grants it immortality. Rather than bearing its heart
within its corpse, a mummy lord removes and hides
this accursed organ. As long as its heart isn't destroyed
by fire, a mummy lord can return to unlife
no matter what doom it meets.
Mummy lords are usually consumed by ageless
plots. Roll on or choose a result from the Mummy
Lord Plots table to determine a mummy lord's ancient
agenda.

Mummy lords typically lurk in the ruins of places
they dwelled in life. Such sites have forbidding reputations,
or they might be lost and forgotten.
The region containing a mummy lord's lair is
warped by its presence, creating the following
effects:
Cursed Fate. Whenever a creature other than the
mummy or one of its allies casts a Divination spell
while within 1 mile of the lair, the creature makes
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed m
save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the
action, Bonus Action, or Reaction used to cast the
spell is wasted, but any resources used to cast it
aren't expended.
Soul Drain. Creatures within 1 mile of the lair have
Disadvantage on Death Saving Throws.
If the mummy lord is destroyed or moves its lair
elsewhere, these effects end immediately. The effects
resume if the mummy lord gains a new body
(see its Undead Restoration trait).

Hulking and grotesque, these demons combine
misshapen, bestial features with ogre{ike frames.
Through both brute force and cunning, nalfeshnees
compel cultists and weaker demons to serve them in
the endless conflicts of the Abyss or in plots on the
Material Plane.
Many nalfeshnees view themselves as prospective
demon Iords and seek to conquer realms of their
own. They often use promises of fiendish magic or
Abyssal alliances to tempt ambitious mortals into
ruinous pacts. Should they run out ofpatience,
nalfeshnees conjure visions of the Abyss and other
nightmares to terrorize others into obeying.

Hag of Nightmare and Corruption
Habitat Planar (Lower Planes); Treasure: Arcana
Night hags seek mortals to torment and turn to evil.
By day, night hags use supernatural deceptions to
plague their victims, shape-shifting to pose as other
creatures and make their targets believe the world
has turned against them. By night, these hags reinforce
their tortures with terrifying dreams. Once
they force their targets to desperate limits, night
hags claim their victims'tormented spirits, capturing
them in sinister traps called soul bags. The hags
then slip between planes of existence to barter stolen
souls to vile magic-users and fiendish entities.
Night hags maintain networks of nefarious customers
and collect rumors from across the Lower
Planes. These hags might part with their secrets in
exchange for magic items and other wicked prices.

Witness to the Weird
Habitar U nderdark; Treasure: Arcana
Consumed by their thirst for forbidden knowledge,
nothics are cursed lore seekers transformed by
secrets never meant to be known. The bodies of
these former scholars are warped into otherworldly
shapes, each with a head dominated by a gigantic,
unblinking eye. Nothics remember nothing of their
past lives and care only for their endless pursuit of
hidden mysteries and uncanny truths. They seek
revelations amid the rubble of forgotten ruins, and
they use their supernatural sight to pierce magical
deceptions, rot the flesh ofenemies, and steal the secrets
of those who interrupt their investigations.
Some nothics seek to end the curse that warped
them into their bizarre forms, but many are unaware
of-or uninterested in-their transformation.

Yugoloth of Strategy and Strife

Fiendish warmongers, nycaloths relish combat and
conquest. These tremendous winged yugoloths teleport
around battlefields and into the air to bewilder
their foes and attack with constantly shifting, Gehenna-
forged axes-mercurial weapons similar to
those favored by many yugoloths.
Nycaloths might command groups of mezzoloths
and make pacts to serve arcanaloths, ultroloths,
fiendish warlords, or wicked mortals. So long as
they can indulge their bloodlust, most nycaloths
are willing to obey more powerful or cunning creatures.
Some even serve competent leaders past the
terms of their agreements to achieve long-pursued
victories. But masters that lead nycaloths to defeat
should fear these proud yugoloths' retribution.
Nycaloths and other yugoloths frequently serve
as mercenary forces in extraplanar conflicts that

Habitat Underdark; Treasure: None
Ochre jellies are giant, yellow-brown amoebas that
digest organic creatures. They tirelessly hunt any
prey smaller than themselves, oozing over, under,
and around obstacles in their path. Once they overwhelm
their quarry, these acidic slimes dissolve the
flesh, hair, and scales of their prey, leaving behind
clothing, equipment, treated leather, and bone.
If damaged by lightning or a slashing weapon, an

Raging Hulks and Hoarders
Habitaü Arctic, Desert, Forest, Grassland, Hill,
M ountai n, Swamp, U nderdark; Treasure: Armaments
Ogres are selfish raiders and hulking gluttons
spawned of hateful supernatural forces. From dismal
ruins and bleak hinterlands, they raid vulnerable
communities and ambush travelers. Ogres covet
food and treasure, and they spitefully destroy art,
books, clockwork devices, and other delicate or lovingly
made things. Occasionally they kidnap victims
to eat later or, more rarely, performers who catch
their interest.
Ogres trace their origins to wrathful deities such
as Erythnul, Takhisis, and Vaprak. They magically
emerge from the earth of lands corrupted by evil
gods, sinister magic, or ancient curses. Some bear
evidence of the places that spawned them, sporting
rocky calluses, mossy growths, or frozen scars.
Ogn,n
Ogres are lO-foot-tall brutes that overwhelm their
foes and take what spoils they please. Ogre raiders
ally with other evil forces in return for food, riches,
and promises of battle.

Ogrillons arise from Humanoids cursed by foul
magic or the will of wrathful deities. They appear
similar to whoever they once were, but they grow to

constantly seethe with supernatural anger, which
they might struggle to control or purposefully vent
on other creatures.

Wickedness Drawn to the Wicked
Habital Forest, Urban; Treasure: Armaments
Oni are elusive entities that inhabit dark forests and
other wildernesses. By shape-shifting into the form
of an innocent or moving invisibly, oni encroach
on communities and lonely roads. They frequently
harass people of faith, testing the limits of their piousness,
or torment selfish people, punishing them
for their wickedness. Wise communities often have
guardian statues, annual rituals, or local superstitions
meant to keep oni at bay. In rare cases, an oni
might gradually befriend such communities and
protect them from other threats for generations.
Oni torment villages that don't pay them or other
supernatural forces respect. Roll on or choose a result

Otyughs live to eat-the more disgusting the meal,

within reach dishes in life's endless buffet. In dumps,
sewers, polluted ruins, and similar murky depths,
otyughs devour garbage, carcasses, and anything
else their tentacles can cram in their expansive
maws. Some creatures ply otyughs with trash to recruit
them as watchful-if disgusting-guardians.
Otyughs often bury themselves amid trash
heaps and observe their surroundings with their
eye-studded stalk. They use glittery trash and telepathic
urgings to coax creatures close, then burst
from hiding, attacking with their spiny tentacles
and filthy maws. Roll on or choose a result from

Perytons are monstrous predators that hunt people-
particularly humans and elves-in favor of all
other prey. With the bodies of mighty avian scavengers
and fanged, stag{ike heads, perytons use
ambush tactics to dive-bomb travelers. Strangely,
the shadows they cast resemble humanoid silhouettes.
This supernatural oddity lends credence to
stories that perytons are cursed humans or elves, or
that they arise from carrion birds that feed on the
corpses of villains.
Perytons tear out the hearts of those they slay,
carrying the organs back to grisly lairs. This gives
rise to numerous superstitions surrounding perytons.
Roll on or choose a result from the Peryton

Phase spiders appear out of nowhere to attack, then
vanish just as swiftly. These horse-size, magical
arachnids are endemic to the Ethereal Plane. From
vaporous lairs, they peer through the Border Ethereal
into the Material Plane. When they detect prey,
phase spiders draw close and then shift or "phase"
to the Material Plane to attack. They shift between
planes ofexistence and attack from unexpected
directions until they overcome their prey or are
forced to retreat.
Phase spiders are more intelligent than mundane
spiders, but most are cowards. They usually flee if
they're outnumbered by creatures capable of seeing
them on the Ethereal Plane or pursuing them there.
They make exceptions for ghosts and similar spirits,
which phase spiders gain sustenance from and pursue
as favored prey.

Piercers resemble stalactites, but each has a toothy
maw and a single eye. They hang from cavern ceilings
along routes frequented by denizens of the Underdark.
Piercers might lurk for months at a time,
waiting for any creature of their approximate size
to pass underneath. When potential meals move
below, piercers release their grip and plummet, intent
on impaling prey in a single strike. If they're
successful, piercers consume their meals and then
slowly climb to a new ambush position. If they
miss or fail to slay their targets, piercers attempt to
squirm away, but they're easily dispatched by creatures
aware of their presence.
Piercers are the larval form of ropers. Young
piercers seek to move as far from ropers as they can
to avoid ropers'undiscerning hunger. Many piercers
migrate vast distances through the Underdark, often
to caverns or buried ruins near the surface.

Habitat: Any; Treasure: lndividual, lmplements
The term "pirate" encompasses a broad range of
seafarers, including vicious sea rovers, dogged privateers,
cursed treasure hunters, and others who
seek riches and fame on the seas.
Pirates might be allies, foes, wild cards, or some
combination thereof. While they are the bane of
merchants and coastal communities, they know
secrets ofthe sea and how to avoid aquatic threats.
More unusual pirates set their sights beyond
the waves, using airships, spelljamming vessels,
plane-shifting craft, or stranger vehicles to explore
and raid incredible realms.
Prnann
Along with being competent warriors, pirates are
accomplished seafarers who know how to sail and
maintain a ship. While some loyally follow their
captains' orders, others place greed, superstition, or
self-preservation over duty.
Prnerr CeprerN
Pirate captains command crews of pirates, dictating
their destinations and targets. Captains cultivate
fearsome and theatrical reputations, painting themselves
as larger-than-life characters to terrorize
their foes, ensure the obedience of their crews,
and attract followers to their banner. Many have
colorful nicknames inspired by signature traits and
deeds.

Devil of Domination
Habitat Planar (Nine Hells);Treasure: Relics
Masterminds of the Nine Hells and generals of infernal
legions, pit fiends seek conquests across the
planes of existence. More than warmongers, these
diabolical tyrants concoct intricate plots that play
out among fiendish battlefields, infernal politics, and
mortal conspiracies.
Pit fiends are the nobility of the Nine Hells, and
many rule Lower Planar fiefdoms, doomed mortal
worlds, and other infernal redoubts. Most serve
archdevils of the Nine Hells as they pursue their
own ambitions. Ranks of lesser devils obey pit
fiends, but these cunning tyrants remain on guard
against betrayal from their servants.
Smoldering with the evil of the Nine Hells, pit
fiends strike fear in creatures with their mere
presence. Despite their size and incredible physical
and magical might, pit fiends are as likely to try to
corrupt foes as they are to destroy them outright.
Pit fiends'arrogance can lead them to underestimate
mortal foes-a failing that can lead to their
downfall.

Pseudodragons dwell in scenic wildernesses, preferably
where life is easy and prey is small and slow.
There they behave like contented wyrms, creating
tiny lairs amid ancient trees and rugged cliffs. They
fill these lairs with shiny rocks, colorful shells, and
unattended treasures that catch their attention, and
they guard these hoards fiercely.
Pseudodragons grow to the size of large house
cats, and most have red-brown scales. Some have
scales with other hues or patterns-markings distinct
from those of their larger draconic cousins.
Many magic-users attempt to befriend pseudodragons,
hoping to enlist them as familiars. The
creatures'intellect and resistance to magic make
them excellent companions, and they're considered
status symbols in some spellcasting circles.
Many pseudodragons prefer the finer things in
life. These diminutive dragons might be inclined
to aid those who ply them with treats. Contrariwise,
mages who don't properly pamper their
pseudodragon familiars might be abandoned
without warning. Roll on or choose an option
from the Pseudodragon Treats table to inspire a

QuaccorHS
Unpre dictable Subterrane an Stalkers
Habitat Underdark; Treasure: None
Beastly hunters endemic to subterranean depths,
quaggoths scrape harsh existences from the Underdark.
While they can survive on bitter lichens
and toxic fungi, they viciously attack anything
they can make a meal of, from giant spiders to explorers.
Quaggoths sometimes serve as muscle for
Underdark-dwelling villains.
Quaggoths frequently collect in small bands
led by the most fearsome group member. These
bands are proud and quick to hold grudges. Anyone
who harms a quaggoth-or who is suspected
of doing so-earns the enmity of that quaggoth's
band regardless of reason or fault. These grudges
sometimes extend to whole communities rather
than individuals. Generations of quaggoths might
seek revenge against a settlement's inhabitants for
decades-old slights. Only the leader of a quaggoth
band can demand that a grudge ends.
QuaccorH
For quaggoths, every fight means life or death. They
battle with wild fury and do anything to survive.
QuaccorH THoNor
Quaggoth thonots possess psionic abilities, which
they use to give themselves an edge in combat and
to coerce the service ofother quaggoths.

Demon of Discord and Disorder
Habitat Planar (Abyss); Treasure: None
Tirelessly destructive, quasits sow discord through
nasty pranks, sabotage, and ambushes. These tiny
demons use chaos and violence to terrorize others.
By shape-shifting into harmless but ill-omened
creatures or by turning invisible, quasits sneak into
places where they spy for villainous masters or
set vicious traps. Quasits delight in hiding in dark
places and-when least expected-bursting forth to
slash foes with their poisoned claws.
Quasits are usually overlooked and underestimated
by other demons. This drives them to prove
themselves through cruel acts or by seeking paths
to the Material Plane. Among mortals, quasits sow
senseless chaos, and they might find kindred evil
spirits among violent cultists and magic-users.

Deceiver Hungry for Power and Flesh
Habitat Planar (Nine Hells), Urban; Treasure: Relics
Masters of manipulation, rakshasas infiltrate communities
to claim positions of power. While disguising
their true natures, they kidnap victims and
indulge their insatiable hunger for flesh.
Rakshasas can withstand some degree of magic,
but legends tell of blessed warriors felling them
with crossbow bolts, arrows, or similar weapons.
Rakshasas' appearances combine humanlike bodies
with the features of animals and monsters. All

they adopt magical disguises, such as palms where
the backs of the hands would be on humans.

recall of the hoards' contents and the locations of all
they've collected. Should anything go missing, red
dragons fly into rages. They don't rest until their
treasures are returned and the thieves have burned.
Red dragons believe themselves to be the greatest
of all dragons and, by extension, the greatest of all
creatures. To them, pillaging and conquering are
their right-treasures can find no more honored
place than in their hoards, and other creatures are
privileged to serve them.

Red dragon wyrmlings are born destroyers. From a

alike. They sometimes restrain themselves
from scorching creatures to instead bully others
into following their orders and bringing them gifts.
YouNc Rn» Dnecou
Young red dragons number among the most unpredictable
of their kind. They seek territories rich
with treasures and potential followers, raiding,
burning, and slaughtering to enforce their will. Unless
these dragons meet significant resistance, they
cement their power and begin reigns of terror that
can last for centuries.

Adult red dragons are tyrants that claim vast domains
and might command armies of followers or
significant magical resources. Red dragons rarely
pay attention to the nations and claims of smaller
creatures, and they might consider entire cities part
of their realm. Most red dragons are inattentive rulers,
though, spending decades focused on their own
comforts, hoards, or magical concerns within their
lairs. But when their attention returns to their territories,
if they find matters not to their liking, whole
lands might burn.
ANcrnNr Rnp DBecoN
Ancient red dragons number among the most feared
and destructive beings in the multiverse. Few can
withstand the wrath of an ancient red dragon that
turns its mind toward devastation. These dragons'
greed matches their ruinous potential, and they collect
vast hoards studded with storied treasures and
magic items. Their lairs frequently tap into volcanic
depths and might pierce other planes of existence,
bringing servants from the Elemental Plane of Fire
or the Lower Planes into their service.
Rno DneGoN LAIRs
Red dragons make their lairs in smoldering, unapproachable
places such as volcanic mountains,
burning wastelands, and ruins they've stolen from
other creatures.
The region containing an adult or ancient red
dragon's lair is warped by its presence, creating the
following effects:
Burning Heat. The area within I mile of the lair is
an area of extreme heat. A burning creature or
object takes an additional 1d4 Fire damage at the
start of each of its turns.
Smoldering Haze. The area within 1 mile of the lair
is Lightly Obscured with clouds of ash. Whenever
a creature other than the dragon or one ofits
allies finishes a Long Rest in that area, that creature
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or have the Poisoned condition for t hour.
If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these
effects end immediately.

Camouflaged as rock formations, ropers are aberrant
ambushers that lurk in wait for smaller creatures.
These bizarre subterranean hunters extend
their rubbery tentacles to explore and prod their
surroundings, often reaching beyond their fields of
vision. Should they encounter prey, these limbs ensnare
victims and drag them close to ropers'toothy
maws. If these tentacles are severed, ropers rapidly
grow replacements.
Ropers can move, albeit slowly. Crawling on the
sticky cilia that cover their undersides, ropers can
climb walls and suspend themselves from ceilings.
These hunters often position themselves in unexpected
or treacherous locations, using their surroundings
to weaken their prey. Roll on or choose a

Ravagers from Beneath the Waves
Habitat Coastal, Underwater; Treasure: Any
Sahuagin are fiendish terrors that prey on creatures
above and below the water. Called "sea devils"
by residents of coastal communities, sahuagin
are ruthless raiders. They ransack ships, fishing
villages, and undersea communities to slake their
bloodthirst, claim treasure, and make sacrifices to
their vicious deity-the sharklike god Sekolah.
Sahuagin constantly war on any peoples living
near their territory. Merfolk and other aquatic folk
bear the brunt ofthese attacks, but sahuagin also
hunt air-breathers who sail over or swim through
the waters the sea devils claim. Sahuagin often attack
alongside sharks, which they can telepathically
command.

Serpentine Artists of the Inferno
Habitat Planar (Elemental Plane of Fire), Underdark;
Treasure: Armaments
Salamanders are serpentine denizens of the Elemental
Plane of Fire. They believe that flames
expose the purest forms of all things and delight in
burning and melting things, seeing fleeting beauty
and striking nuances in blazes consuming different
fuels-ancient forests, artistic masterpieces, or living
creatures. To salamanders, those that can't endure
their flames are nothing but ashes in disguise.
They harbor malice toward few creatures, but they
consider creating remarkable flames more important
than the pain and Ioss their fires cause.
Salamanders are typically content to dwell on
the Elemental Plane of Fire, creating strange, temporary
art amid the flames. Some travel to other
planes of existence and worlds to experience the
flames of other realms or create conflagrations of
unprecedented scale.
Se14.-y 4_N-g_,E B FIRF §NA sE
Juvenile salamanders emerge from burning hot,
two-foot-diameter eggs. Called fire snakes, these
serpentlike creatures slither through the Plane of
Fire and other intensely hot places. After consuming
the proper fuels and exposing themselves to
fiery extremes, fire snakes grow into salamanders.

Most salamanders are arrogant yet curious, seeking
to create artful blazes or burn that which has
never been burned. They eagerly explain their work
to strangers before trying to determine how the
strangers burn. Salamanders radiate intense heat,
which is conducted by their blazing weapons.
SareueNDER INFERNo MASTER
Salamander inferno masters are ancient connoisseurs
of flames and often inhabit places with unique
scorching properties. They gather communes of
apprentices who learn fiery techniques while helping
their mentors accomplish great works. Inferno
masters have ambitious goals, such as causing
massive volcanic eruptions, opening portals to
burning planes, destroying Artifacts, or burning all
instances of something from the multiverse.

Vestige of Evil
Habitat Planar (Abyss); Treasure: None
Shadow demons form when exceptionally wicked
demons are destroyed and prevented from reconstituting
their physical forms in the Abyss. This might
occur due to divine intervention, when a demon
is destroyed in the Abyss, or under more unusual
circumstances. Shadow demons are the incorporeal
remnants of these destroyed demons' evil. They
usually vaguely resemble their former shapes, but
some take purposefully deceptive shapes. Many lurk
in dark places or venture out only at night to hide
their true forms from those they manipulate.

Shadow demons seek ways to regain their former
might and take revenge on those who destroyed
them. They often ingratiate themselves with more
powerful demons or mortal spellcasters, bargaining
with and coercing others into restoring them to
power. Many try to claim or corrupt souls to restore
their fiendish forms, while some shadow demons
seek wicked relics or nexuses of profane magic. It
typically takes shadow demons centuries to recover
their demonic power, if they ever do.
Particularly powerful demons might return as
multiple shadow demons after being defeated. These
fiendish entities each think they're the true manifestation
of their past self and hunt one another to
recover their power.
In rare cases, Fiends other than demons might

Dragon Corrupted by Darkness
Habitat Planar (Shadowfell), Underdark; Treasure: Any
Shadow dragons haunt forgotten, Iightless places.
While they might have once been other types of
dragons, the influence of planar forces, negative
energy, or sinister magic has stripped them of their
former color or luster. In place of any former breath
weapon, shadow dragons exhale caliginous gouts
that saps life from everything it touches. Those
slain by a shadow dragon's breath rise as shades
obedient to the shadow dragon's will.
Shadow dragons typically dwell in the Underdark,
particularly in areas with connections to the Shadowfell
or other tenebrous realms. In some cases,
they might lurk in dark, corrupted reaches of the
regions they preferred before transforming into
shadow dragons. Overgrown swamps, sepulchral
desert ruins, and ash-choked volcanoes make natural
lairs for shadow dragons.
Like many other dragons, shadow dragons collect
hoards. Their tastes tend to be morbid-collecting
coins from ruined empires and their victims' skulls.
Snenow DnacoN LaIns
Shadow dragons lair in places of darkness and
despair, such as accursed ruins, the depths ofthe
Underdark, or the Shadowfell.
The region around a shadow dragon's lair is
twisted by its presence, creating the following
effects:
Negative Energy Suffusion. Whenever a creature
within 1 mile of the lair regains Hit Points from
a spell, it subtracts 1d10 from the number of Hit
Points regained.
Stifling Shadows. Within I mile of the lair, effects
that normally create Bright Light instead create
Dim Light, and creatures there have Advantage
on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these
effects end immediately.

Shambling mounds-also known as "shamblers"-
embody the tenacity of the wilderness, seeking only
to consume and grow. These masses of vegetation
rise up to half again as tall as a human and possess
thick limbs and a vague head. As they move through
bogs and undergrowth, they ensnare creatures that
come within reach. Shambling mounds bury those
they catch within their own forms as compost.
Strange circumstances might give rise to shambling
mounds, transforming vegetation into hulks
with rudimentary cunning. Such conditions include
strikes from magical lightning, nature defending
itself, or druidic curses. Roll on or choose a result
from the Shambling Mound Cultivation table to inspire
a shambling mound's origins and features.

D eyice - Controlled Magic al Bo dy guard
Habitat Urban; Treasure: None
An intimidating magical automaton, a shield guardian
obeys its master's commands and protects its
master from danger. When such a guardian is created,
the magic that animates it is intertwined with
a bonded command amulet. Any creature that has
a shield guardian's command amulet can control
that Construct and, in the case of magic-users, imbue
it with a spell to unleash under predetermined
circumstances. Yet a shield guardian's primary goal
is to protect its master. It escorts whoever bears
its command amulet and intercedes between the
bearer and any threat. Although it isn't mindless,
a shield guardian has no sense of self preservation
and will sacrifice itself to protect its master.
Shield guardians are typically constructed of
steel, stone, and wood in the shape of watchful
soldiers. More fanciful designs exist, reflecting
the tastes oftheir creators. Given their resilience,
it's common for shield guardians to eventually
serve creatures other than their creators. A shield
guardian's command amulet might be passed
down through a magic-using society or family for
generations.

Spell Storing. A spellcaster who wears the guardian's

heroes and have grand ambitions. Many collect
treasures that reflect these interests, such as histories,
ancient art, and the gear of famous champions.

Adult silver dragons love to spend time among
various peoples. Rather than manipulating politics
directly, they support individuals who have ambitious
goals or who popularize the return of great
universities, inspiring athletics events or festivals,
and other salutary civic institutions of the past'
Silver dragons often surround themselves with likeminded
allies and are watchful for hidden threats.
ANcrrNr Srrvnn DnecoN
Ancient silver dragons pursue world-wide change.
They defend their communities and allies, encouraging
them to perform deeds worthy of legend.
Some set their sights on other worlds and planes of
existence, creating extraplanar alliances or combating
multiplanar threats. They might have guises
in multiple societies and forge generation-spanning
friendships with heroic families or valorous groups.

Silver dragons typically lair in picturesque mountain
retreats or on sculpted cloud "islands."
The region containing an adult or ancient silver
dragon's lair is changed by its magic, creating the
following effects:
Gentle Gusts. Winds buoy creatures that fall
within 1 mile of the lair. Such creatures descend
at a rate of 6O feet per round and take no damage
from falling.
Sun and Storms. While in its lair, the dragon can
cast ControlWeather, requiring no Material components
and using the same spellcasting ability as
its Spellcasting action.
If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these
effects end immediately.

Skeletons rise at the summons of necromancers
and foul spirits. Whether they're the remains of the
ancient dead or fresh bones bound to morbid ambitions,
they commit deathless work for whatever
forces reanimated them, often serving as guardians,
soldiers, or laborers. In rare cases, skeletons are
reanimated but given no particular direction. Roll
on or choose a result from the Skeleton Pantomimes
table to inspire how undirected skeletons behave.

Chaos-Spawned Hordes of Limbo
Habitat Planar (Limbo); Treasure: Any
Unpredictable slaadi devour and multiply across the
Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo. These toad{ike,
extraplanar beings embody the endless potentiality
of their home plane of existence. While slaadi aren't
inherently evil, their impulses are wild and often
destructive. Many are driven to propagate through
supernatural processes. Unfortunately, these processes
typically are fatal for other creatures.
Slaadi have no formal society. Rather, strong
slaadi dominate weaker ones. Blue and red slaadi
rampage across Limbo and spill into other worlds at
the direction of green slaadi. More powerful slaadi
have connections to the Spawning Stone, a source
of chaotic magic from which the first slaadi originated.
The Spawning Stone is hidden deep within
Limbo, and legends tie its origins to the modron
overlord Primus or the ruinous slaad lords, such as
Ssendam, the golden amoeboid terror, and Ygorl, the
winged skeleton. These slaad lords and others plot
to spread slaadi across the multiverse.
Sra,a.» Tenporn
Slaad tadpoles are ravenous, newborn slaadi. They
hatch from eggs implanted into living hosts by red
slaadi, but they also appear in great numbers in
Limbo and other chaotic realms. Under most conditions,
a slaad tadpole transforms into a blue slaador
a green slaad if its host was able to cast spells of
level 5 or higher-within 2d12 hours of hatching.

Red slaadi amass in vast tli.ong, in Limbo. There
they wrestle and croak-sing as they endlessly dismantle
and rebuild islands of drifting planar matter.
When they encounter non-slaadi, red slaadi seek to
play with, telepathically converse with, or devour
the other creatures. These whims change from
moment to moment. Red slaadi instinctively avoid
harming those bearing slaadi eggs, which red slaadi
implant using their claws, or other slaad curses.
Brun Sree»
Almost as numerous as red slaadi, blue slaadi are
muscular brutes with vicious blades extending from
the backs of their claws. These claws carry a magical
curse called chaos phage, which can transform
victims into red or green slaadi. Blue slaadi accompany
red slaadi and behave similarly. They innately
know the signs of chaos phage and avoid slaying
creatures that carry it or other slaad curses.

A slaad born from the Spawning Stone has a magical
control gem embedded in its head. lf a creature
claims the gem, the slaad has the Charmed
condition and obeys the gem's bearer. The slaad
ceases to be Charmed if it is harmed by the gem's
bearer or the bearer's allies or if the gem is returned
to the slaad. A Greater Restoration spell
cast on a slaad destroys the gem, and the slaad
ceases to be Charmed.
One can obtain a slaad's control gem using a
Wish or lmprisonmenl spell. lf the slaad fails its
saving throw against lmprisonment, the caster
gains the gem, and the slaad isn't imprisoned. An
lncapacitated slaad's control gem can be removed
by spending I minute and succeeding on a DC
20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Failing this check
deals 22 (4d10) Piercing damage to the slaad.

Green slaadi come into being when the propagation
methods of red or blue slaadi affect certain creatures
capable of casting spells of level 5 or higher.
Green slaadi are more intelligent than their blue and
red brethren and often direct their kin to portals
where gray slaadi have identified Humanoid communities
ripe for invasion.

Gray slaadi arise from green slaadi transformed by
the Spawning Stone or slaad lords. They explore the
planes, seeking Humanoid communities to invade
near planar pathways.

Slaad lords create death slaadi by infusing gray
slaadi with a portion of their chaotic energy. When
groups of slaadi act deliberately, death slaadi are often
behind their designs.

Solars stand as the final line of defense between
unspeakable evils and the order of the multiverse.
They are the servants ofjust deities and ageless
forces of good. Their interests span the planes, but
they rarely intervene in conflicts on the worlds of
the Material Plane. When they act, they lead vast
angelic hosts and wield.holy weapons capable of laying
low the wickedest Fiends.
Solars can resurrect the dead and often use that
power to enlist mortal aid. They bestow grand, new
purposes on those they return to life. Solars don't
enforce these destinies, but they trust in the potential
of mortals to achieve great things.

Habitat Underdark; Treasure: Any
Invoking mysterious rites involving four beholder
eyestalks, a spellcaster can mold aberrant dreams
into a beholder{ike guardian. Called a spectator,
the being summoned by such a ritual resembles a
beholder with five magical eyes-a central eye and
four on stalks arrayed around the crown of the
creature's spherical body.
A spectator serves its conjurer for 101 years by
guarding something of the spellcaster's choice-typically
a treasure or location. The spectator is a reliable
guardian and allows only its summoner access
to what it protects. A spectator might converse with
other creatures, openly discussing its orders and the
magic-user who conjured it, but it has no ambitions
of its own and won't abandon its post. Should an intruder
ignore its warnings, a spectator attempts to
drive away the intruder with its magical eye rays.
At the end of its service, a spectator might discorporate
back into nothingness or wander away, seeking
to learn more of the multiverse.

Collectors and Keepers of Secrets
Habitat Desert, Planar (Upper Planes); Treasure: Arcana
Sphinxes protect the secrets of the multiverse.
Formed from the spirits of sages and explorers,
sphinxes know the power of truth and the importance
of preserving it. They share their wisdom
only with those who prove themselves wise or overcome
tests of worthiness, such as riddles or battles
with dangerous beasts. Through their existences,
sphinxes might change form as they gain more nuanced
understanding of cosmic enigmas.
SpnrNx oF WoNDER
A sphinx of wonder is brightly feathered and the
size of a lion cub. One comes into being every time
a unique idea is conceived on the Material Plane.
Each sphinx of wonder is fascinated by a particular
type of story or field of study, and it learns all it
can about that topic. It bears a unique sigil on its
forehead that suggests the type of knowledge that
fascinates it. Sometimes, a sphinx of wonder forms
a bond with a mortal scholar and aids them in their
research.

Sphinxes of secrets are commonly associated with
a site of great magic or learning. These immortal
beings often outlive such locations, though, and
might protect a site's ruins as they continue their
own studies. Sphinxes of secrets fiercely guard their
dwellings and research.
SpnrNx oF LoRE
Sphinxes of lore each know a great secret and protect
it all costs. This truth might take the form of an
ancient text, a magical puzzle, or a path to another
world. These sphinxes might gain reputations as

mortal life. If threatened, a sphinx of valor defends

Elusive Defender of Fey Realms
Habitau Forest, Planar (Feywild); Treasure: Armaments
Sprites dwell in mystical forests touched by the
magic of the Feywild, living peacefully with most
other Fey and friends of nature. These foot-tall
spirits of nature resemble elves with exaggerated,
whimsical features and gossamer wings.
Sprites can sense the innate goodness or wickedness
of other creatures. Those that enter their
realms with good intentions might be treated to
tiny feasts and celebrations. The wicked face nasty
tricks and bold ambushes at the hands of invisible
sprite defenders. These woodland guardians enchant
the arrows of their tiny bows with charming
magic that can pierce the heart of the fiercest foe.
Sprites oppose any creatures that seek to harm
places of natural magic and beauty. This can put
them into conflict with would-be settlers, monsters
like ettercaps, and despoilers such as goblinoids and
hags. They frequently aid other good creatures of
the forest, including treants and unicorns, in defending
their homes.

Giant of the Earth
Habitau Mountain, U nderdark; Treasure: Armaments
In cavernous depths and amid mountain canyons,
stone giants contemplate the strength and persistence
ofthe earth. Stone giants have rugged features
and skin with patterns and hues similar to the
rock common near their homes. This makes them
adept at blending in with their stony surroundings
despite their size.
Stone giants rarely interfere in the affairs of other
creatures, whether their smaller neighbors or other
Giants. Most are slow to act, preferring to weather
hardships or wait out perilous times. When roused
to action-particularly when sites of ancient wonder
or their homes are threatened-stone giants can
unleash the might of mountains and crush foes with
the force ofan avalanche.
Stone giants often ponder the mysteries of natural
wonders, such as mountain spires, crystal formations,
or mystical petroglyphs. Some know much
about the magic and secret messages hidden within
the earth. Those who confine themselves to the
Underdark often regard the surface world and its
inhabitants as dreams imagined into being by slumbering
primordials, strange gods, or other entities.

Giant of Seas and Skies
Habitat: Coastal, U nderwater; Treasure: Armaments
Among the tallest giants, storm giants live amid
extreme forces ofnature. In palaces at the bottom
of the sea and castles floating amid the clouds, they
revel in the power of mighty storms. When angered,
they can shape the weather and call down devastating
lightning. More often, though, these giants
watch the rise and fall of nations and interpret
supernatural omens, interfering in the world only
when they're needed most.

SuccuBUs
Life-Draining Seducer
Habita[ Planar (Lower Planes), Urban;
Treasure: lmplements
Succubi prey on mortals physically and exploit their
waking desires. They relish corrupting virtuous
souls and the pain an individual's downfall can
cause. Once their targets are at their lowest, succubi
slay their victims with their essence-draining kiss.
Through fiendish rites, succubi can transform into
incubi to manipulate their prey in dreams as well
as the waking world. They can also change shape
to torment their victims. These tempters can dominate
Humanoids, but they usually do so to reinforce
their manipulations or defend themselves rather
than controlling others outright. Roll on or choose
a result from the Succubus Temptations table to inspire
how a succubus toys with its victims.

The Shape of Calamity
Habitat Urban; Treasure: None
Among the most devastating creatures in existence,
the tarrasque is an engine of catastrophe and a
ruiner of nations. A terror of massive size and overwhelming
might, this primeval destroyer survives
from the earliest epochs of the Material Plane,
when it served as a weapon of immortal forces.
Since then, the tarrasque has slumbered in secret,
rising every few ages to usher in eras of destruction
The tarrasque is a bipedal, prehistoric Monstrosity
that stands over seventy feet tall. Bristling with
horns and spikes, its spiny carapace deflects harm
and can reflect magical attacks.
The tarrasque is a creature oftireless rage. It
lashes out at any creature that catches its attention,
thrashing with claws and its mighty tail while
swallowing smaller beings whole. It seems to take
instinctual offense at the works of lesser beings,
venting its rage at buildings, bridges, ships, and
monuments. The larger a structure or foe is, the
greater the tarrasque's wrath.
It is a mystery what-if anything-calms the tarrasque,
but eventually it returns to its slumber,
leaving the world irrevocably changed. While the
tarrasque might be halted by incredible opposition,
its threat can never be wiped from the multiverse.
Whenever the tarrasque is defeated, another tarrasque
awakes somewhere else on the Material
Plane.

Few things survive the tarrasque's rampages,
and reports of the monster's devastation are often
contradictory, incomplete, or beyond belief. In cases
where it leaves no survivors, its calamities might
initially be blamed on evil dragons or magical disasters,

some unmistakable indication of its passage. Roll

Habitat U nderdark; Treasure: Armaments
With features similar to those of pale cave lizards,
troglodytes stalk the Underdark in an endless hunt
for food. Troglodytes consume almost anything, including
bones, giant insects, and other subterranean
dwellers. They prey on subterranean communities
and those near entrances to the Underdark, stealing
livestock and kidnapping residents.
Troglodytes prefer to ambush prey and can
change their scale color to blend in with their surroundings.
They often climb along cavern walls
or emerge from deep fissures to take their prey by
surprise. Despite their stealthiness, these stalkers
exude a distinctly repulsive stench. Descriptions
of what troglodytes smell like span a spectrum as
complex as it is vile. This reek nauseates many who
smell it, but it can also warn of the presence of troglodytes
before they strike.

Trolls creep forth to prey on smaller creatures and
drag captives back to festering lairs. These misshapen
brutes can regenerate from wounds and
regrow severed body parts-including their heads.
A troll's severed limbs continue to move and attack.
Unless they're burned by flames or acid, trolls can
recover from egregious wounds and seek revenge
on those who felled them.
Trolls typically hunt alone, but small groups
occasionally cooperate to ambush prey or raid villages.
Creatures such as hags and hill giants might
convince trolls to work for them in exchange for
disgusting meals.

With uncanny patience and fiendish cunning, ultro-

alike, seeking to hoard power and spread suffering.
These sinister masterminds often work with other
yugoloths, but they might compel nearly any creature
into their service. If coercion doesn't work,
ultroloths use their eerie eyes and innate magic to
hypnotize or charm targets.
Ultroloths strive to achieve planes-spanning plots.

Burrowing Brute from Below
Habitat Underdark; Treasure: None
Lumbering, carapace-armored bipeds, umber hulks
burrow through the Underdark, feeding on anything
they can crush in their mighty mandibles.
These tenacious hunters sense movement through
the surrounding earth, then burst through cavern
walls to surprise their prey. Those ambushed by
umber hulks risk meeting the gaze of the monsters'
eerie, multifaceted eyes, which can cause others to
act irrationally and even lash out at their allies.
Umber hulks typically lurk in tunnels they've
burrowed alongside other passages. When they detect
creatures moving, they burst through the rock
walls between the passages to attack. While these
monsters can communicate with one other, they
usually hunt alone and avoid each other's territories.
Umber hulks focus on finding food and crushing
intruders. They have little interest in allying
with other creatures, but manipulative inhabitants
of the Underdark, such as beholders and mind flayers,
sometimes compel umber hulks to serve them.

While the youngest vampires might be little more

Vampire familiars are living people who serve vampires,
either willingly or due to coercion by their
deathless masters. They channel deathly energy
through their weapons, incapacitating unsuspecting
targets and leaving their victims as helpless prey for
their vampire masters.
Many vampire familiars aspire to eventually become
vampires, while others are magically charmed
or serve as part of some terrible bargain. In each
case, these vampire servants show signs of their
vampiric corruption, such as corpseJike complexions,
uncanny reflexes, and evidence of their masters'
repeated feedings. A vampire familiar loses
its supernatural abilities and returns to its original
Humanoid state if its vampire master is destroyed.

cities or sequestered in ruins where they
dwelled in life.
The region containing a vampire's lair is warped

over the animals in its domain. From dusk
until dawn, Medium or smaller Beasts have the
Charmed condition while within 1 mile of the lair.
Looming Shadows. Shadows within 1 mile of the

on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit
from that rest.
Mists. The area within 1 mile of the lair is Lightly
Obscured by a persistent, creeping fog. The vampire
and any creatures ofits choice are unaffected
by the fog.
If the vampire dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these
effects end immediately.

Demon of Carnage and Ruin
Habitat: Planar (Abyss); Treasure: Armaments
Screeching, vulturelike demons, vrocks soar from
the Abyss to spread ruin and slaughter. Their filthy
feathers carry magical toxins from the Lower
Planes, creating a noxious cloud capable of killing
those who escape the vrocks'vicious beaks and
claws. To further terrorize their foes, vrocks unleash
an otherworldly screech so terrible it can halt
creatures in their tracks.

with the might of surging waves. Water elementals
are as mutable as liquid, allowing them to crash
into foes and seep through narrow cracks. They
can crush foes with limblike geysers, or they might
flood over creatures, submerging and drowning foes
within their whirling forms. Water elementals often
appear near nexuses of elemental power, such as
aquatic abysses, magical springs, and whirlpools.

Servant of Primeval Magic
Habitat Underdark, Urban; Treasure: Any
Serpentine nature spirits, water weirds protect
pools, fountains, and magical bodies of water. In the
water, these creatures are indistinguishable from
the liquid surrounding them. Should their aquatic
territory be disturbed, they rise as animate water
spouts with vague snake- or dragon-like features.
Often their appearance is enough to drive off foes,
but if forced to fight, water weirds crush enemies
within their fluid coils.
Water weirds might protect a site for generations
and learn much about their surroundings. Some
gain reputations as oracles and might respond to
questions posed to them in Primordial. Since water
weirds don't speak, they often communicate using
spouts of water or objects submerged in their pools.

- dragons fiercely protect their territories, scouring
the frigid regions for food and evidence oftrespassers.
Most white dragons ignore the plots of smaller
creatures and other dragons, concerning themselves
only with their own survival.
White dragons create lairs to defend themselves
from other deadly arctic creatures and from dangerous
natural conditions. Within these shelters,
white dragons hoard testaments to their superiority,
such as monstrous skulls, the gear of defeated
rivals, and curiosities that capture their interest.
To protect such treasure, white dragons coax ice to
form over their hoards or sink their wealth in frigid
pools. For white dragons, each piece of treasure
embodies a victory-the details of which inflate as
these dragons age.
Wnrrr DnacoN Wvnurruc
White dragon wyrmlings usually head off on their
own soon after hatching. While the cold means little
to these creatures, food is scarce in arctic realms,
and predators there are merciless. Most white
dragon wyrmlings survive by scavenging, hunting
opportunistically, and quickly fleeing foes-including
other white dragons.
'W-nrrn DnacoNs
Dragons of Cold and Cruelty
Habitat Arctic; Treasure: Arcana
Among the most primal chromatic dragons, white
dragons prioritize survival over all. Life is harsh
and uncertain in the arctic expanses, glacial heights,
and frozen seas where these dragons dwell. White

Young white dragons defend their hunting grounds
from rivals. In some cases, kobolds and groups of
humanoids might offer food and treasure to young
white dragons, attempting to keep the dragons satiated
and less likely to prey on their communities.
Aourr WHrrn DnecoN
Adult white dragons claim large territories and are
often the mightiest predators in those lands. While
some lurk in their lairs for months, others regularly
soar over their domains. When they spot something
moving on the ice, they might swoop down to feed
or extort food and offerings from sapient creatures.
ANcrrNr Wnrrn DnacoN
Like arctic storms, ancient white dragons threaten
icy realms. They emerge from their frozen lairs to
indulge their hungers for food or treasure, menacing
other creatures with lethal cold. While they
might ignore animals or small groups of polar wanderers,
these dragons are quick to challenge other
dragons and creatures wielding powerful magic,
hoping to add their foes' skulls and magic items to
their own hoards.
'W.nrrn DnecoN Lerns
White dragons brood in bitterly cold lairs clawed
from stone and ice.
The region containing an adult or ancient white
dragon's lair is affected by its presence, creating the
following effects:
Frigid Cold. The area within 1 mile of the lair is an
area of extreme cold. Any water in that area is
frigid water. See the Dungeon Mqster's Guide for
rules on extreme cold and frigid water.
Glacial Gloom. The area within 1 mile of the lair is
Lightly Obscured by chilly fog. Whenever a creature
other than the dragon or one ofits allies finishes
a Long Rest in that area, that creature must
succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or
have its Speed reduced by 10 feet for t hour.
If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these
effects end immediately.

Wights are the withered corpses of relentless
warriors whose wickedness sustains them beyond
death. Unlike mere zombies, they retain the memories
and evil agendas they harbored in life.
After dying and returning from the grave, a wight
continues its villainous ways, but it is now driven
by a hunger for life. A wight drains living essence
through its attacks. Humanoids slain by a wight's
life-sapping grip reanimate a day later and serve the

Winter wolves are horse-size, supernatural predators
that prowl frigid wildernesses in deadly packs.
With their great size and chilling breath, winter
wolves pursue megafauna, arctic travelers, and any
other creatures they catch on the tundra.
Winter wolves are more intelligent than natural
wolves and can speak. Most are predominantly concerned
with their next meal, and while they might
converse with other creatures in exchange for food,
few concern themselves with long-term bargains
or keeping their word unless they have something
to gain. Winter wolves often hunt alongside frost
giants that indulge them with frequent hunts and
reliable meals.

Draconic Hunter with a Venomous Sting
Habitat Hill, Mountain; Treasure: Any
Opportunistic predators, wyverns are draconic
ambushers that strike from above. These territorial
hunters attack with their fangs and stinger-tipped
tails. Wyvern stingers drip with deadly venom, a
painful toxin feared by monster hunters and coveted
by alchemists.
Wyverns are aggressive and claim sizable territories
around the mountains, crags, and ruins where
they dwell. Despite their considerable strength,
they're opportunistic hunters that target unwitting
livestock and groups of encamped travelers.
Wyverns usually land only to finish off creatures
they've weakened with their poison and strafing attacks.
Creatures that fight back or take flight might
deter wyverns, convincing them to search for easier
prey.
Once wyverns overpower a quarry, they carry
it to their cavernous lairs to either consume it in
safety or trap it to eat later. Most wyverns don't
hoard treasure, but their lairs are littered with the
possessions of past victims. It isn't uncommon for
wyverns to carry off chests, carts, or small boats
along with their prey.

Habitat Underdark, Planar (Elemental Plane of Earth);
Treasure: Any
On the Elemental Plane of Earth, xorn roam in
search of meals they consider delicacies: gems,
crystals, and veins of precious metals. For xorn, the
Elemental Plane of Earth presents an endless buF
fet. Those that find their way to the Material Plane
discover that most worlds are culinary wastelands.
These xorn scour subterranean depths, consuming
whatever sparse gems and ores they find. This
might bring them into conflict with miners or others
who hide their treasures underground.
Xorn have three eyes, three arms, and three legs
arranged around their trilaterally symmetrical
frames. At the top of their bodies is a toothy maw
that's equally capable of crushing minerals and
dangerous creatures. Xorn move through the earth
magically, leaving no tunnel or sign of their passage.
Rapt gourmands, xorn focus on their next meals.
They care little for living creatures and avoid harming
them when possible. They know others also
covet the earth's treasures, and they're not above
bargaining for their meals. Xorn might share their
knowledge of the Underdark in exchange for snacks
of gems, coins, or magical metals. If starving or angered,
xorn might try to forcibly take their meals.
Roll on or choose a result from the Xorn Delicacies
table to inspire a xorn's favorite fare.

Chilling Stalkers of the Frozen Wilds
Habitau Arctic; Treasure: Any
Across alpine extremes and frozen frontiers, yetis
hunt those that trespass in their territories. Reclusive
and merciless, they resemble giant apes with
pale fur and ramlike horns. Yetis easily blend in
with snow and icy cliffs, revealing themselves with
blood-chilling howls just before striking with their
icy claws. In addition to their physical might, yetis
can chill creatures with a look, freezing their foes in
place, and they can conjure ice and hurl it at foes.
Due to yetis' elusiveness, folktales about yetis are
more common than sightings. Whether a distant
scream is the howl of an enraged yeti orjust the
wind, few can be certain. Nevertheless, many mountainous
settlements burn bonfires to ward off yetis,
taking advantage ofthese brutes'aversion to fire.
Yrrr
Yetis hunt alone or in small family groups. They
avoid the settlements of other creatures but lurk
near paths frequented by traders and herders to
pick off unsuspecting prey. Yetis make their homes
in icy caves near frozen peaks and at extremes
where few dare travel.
AsoN,IrNeBLE YETI
Giants even among their own intimidating kind,
abominable yetis are stronger and bloodthirstier
than their kin. They claim whole regions as their
hunting grounds, and they might track trespassers
for days. On sighting prey, abominable yetis fling
boulders of ice and snow before closing to finish
foes. In addition to their icy claws and gaze, they
can exhale a blast of arctic cold.
Abominable yetis dwell in frigid ruins or the deserted
lairs of other monsters atop infamous peaks.

Demon of Depraved Will
Habitat Planar (Abyss); Treasure: None
Yochlols embody the pernicious will and infectious
philosophies of the Abyss. In their rarely seen
true forms, these noxious manipulators appear
as ever-shifting masses of dripping tentacles and
toxic flesh crowned by a single baleful eye. More
often, though, yochlols take the form of spiders or
zealous cultists. They use manipulative magic and
dangerous rhetoric to spread demonic cults, corrupt
the righteous, and further the plots oftheir fiendish
overlords. They relish coercing the unwitting
into furthering demonic plots and turning mortals
against one another.
Most yochlols serve Lolth. The Demon Queen of
Spiders claims all yochlols as minions and orders
anyyochlols that disagree destroyed. In rare cases,
yochlols might serve other demon lords, particularly
manipulative or changeable ones like Graz'zt,
Juiblex, and Zuggtmoy.
Despite their service to demon lords, yochlols harbor
their own vicious whims and ambitions. They
might claim to speak for their overlords to further
their own ambitions or seek to reveal rivals' selfish
goals to gain standing with their demonic masters.

Exploiting pacts with sinister supernatural forces,
yuan-ti bargain away their humanity for the lethality
and predatory deviousness of serpents. From
hidden bastions, they manipulate rulers and the
wealthy, seeking to control the world. Many yuan-ti
possess venomous magic, which often manifests as
fangs or striking serpents.
Yuan-ti have humanlike forms with a variety of
horrifying serpentine transformations. Some have
a scattering of reptilian scales, while others are giants
that are more snake than human. Typically, the
more snakelike yuan-ti are, the greater esteem they
hold among their kind.
Yuan-ti might gain their reptilian features
through dangerous supernatural rites. Roll on or

table to inspire how yuan-ti obtain their serpentine

Yuan-ti abominations have traded away nearly all
evidence of their humanity, coming to resemble
giant, upright serpents with scaly arms and hands.
In battle, they relish opportunities to crush foes in
their powerful coils or strike with their venomous
fangs. These abominations can also shape-shift into
snakes. In these forms, abominations are indistinguishable
from normal serpents.
The true threat of yuan-ti abominations stems not
from their physical might but from their cunning.
These masterminds often lead cultlike cells of other
yuan-ti and direct them in enacting elaborate conspiracies.
Abominations avoid jeopardizing themselves,
typically scheming from hidden bastions
where they're protected by yuan-ti and serpent
guardians. These coldhearted leaders have a unique
understanding of the supernatural forces that
grant yuan-ti their powers, and they usually have
insidious magical traps and contingencies at their
disposal.

Zombies are unthinking, reanimated corpses, often
gruesomely marred by decay and lethal traumas.
They serve whatever supernatural force animates
them-typically evil necromancers or fiendish spirits.
Zombies are relentless, merciless, and resilient,
and their dead flesh can carry on even after suffering
grievous wounds. While they can follow simple
orders, they rely on primal drives rather than
thought. They fulfill commands by working tirelessly
or battering through foes, but they are easily
stymied by barriers or unexpected circumstances.
Zombies are usually created from Humanoid
corpses, but the remains of other creatures can also
become zombies. Such monstrous zombies might
possess the strength they had in life or a measure
of their supernatural abilities, but they employ such
abilities haphazardly at best.
Zoti,rsrr
Humanoid zombies usually serve as guardians, servants,
or soldiers for evil magic-users. In rare cases,
foul magic might result in widespread reanimation
of the dead, unleashing hordes of zombies to terrorize
the living.

Ogre zombies serve as tireless labor and undying
weapons of war. These massive zombies possess the
size and strength to break through barriers that repel
smaller zombies.
Bnnor»rR ZoMBTE
Zombies animated from the corpses of beholders retain
some use of those monsters' magical eyestalks.
These hovering corpses rely on their magic to destroy
impediments and paralyze foes, allowing them
to savage foes with their rotting maws.
Magic-using beholders typically raise these
abominations from the corpses of defeated rivals.
