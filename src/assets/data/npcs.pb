ÈManshoon (Clone)2-
Waterdeep - Dragon Heist	WTC C4658ÐÐ:GenericBÈReferred to in this adventure simply as 'Manshoon', this clone of the ancient archwizard infiltrated \Place{Waterdeep} years ago and has been hiding out in \Place{Kolat Towers} ever since, in the city's \Place{Southern Ward}.

The original \NPC{Manshoon} was one of the founders of the \Group{Zhentarim}. Evil to the core, he made enemies all across  \Place{FaertÃ»n}, including other powerful spellcasters such as \NPC{Khelben Arunsun} and \NPC{Elminster}. Fearing that he might be destroyed by his foes, \NPC{Manshoon} magically crafted several clones - but a mishap caused all of them to be awakened at once, whereupon they tried to destroy one another in a series of conflicts that came to be known as the \Event{Manshoon Wars}.

Now the original \NPC{Manshoon} is dead, and it's widely believed that all his clones were destroyed as well. In fact, at least three are still alive. The one presently in \Place{Waterdeep} escaped death by hiding out in \Place{Undermountain}, where he eventually ran afoul of \NPC{Halaster Blackcloak}. After a brief spell duel, \NPC{Halaster} captured \NPC{Manshoon} and amputated his left arm at the elbow for reasons unknown. \NPC{Manshoon} escaped imprisonment and fled \Place{Undermountain}, taking refuge in the city above. Attempts to magically regenerate his severed limb failed, forcing him to craft an artificial arm and hand for himself.

\NPC{Manshoon} took control of \Place{Kolat Towers}, a crumbling residence in the \Place{Southern Ward} that was abandoned years ago by the two wizards who built it. The edifice is surrounded by a magical barrier that has the properties of a wall of force. \NPC{Manshoon} rarely leaves the towers and uses a teleportation circle when he must do so, and thus is never seen entering or leaving. \NPC{Manshoon} aims to rule \Place{Waterdeep} and replace the \Group{City Watch} with \Group{Black Network} mercenaries that are loyal to him alone. By bribing and blackmailing the \Group{Masked Lords}, he hopes to oust \NPC{Laeral Silverhand} as \NPC{Open Lord} and take her place, kill the \NPC{Blackstaff}, reduce the \Group{Masked Lords} to mere vassals, and declare himself the Wizard-King of \Place{Waterdeep}. Once the city is firmly in his clutches, Manshoon will then turn his attention toward \Place{Undermountain}, destroy \NPC{Halaster} once and for all, and claim the dungeon's riches.J"A clone of the ancient archwizard.rmanshoon.webp"´

Mobar is smitten by \NPC{Wyllow} and follows her instructions without question. He spends his idle hours making gifts for her and, in bat form, leaving them in front of her tower. The lovestruck fool is otherwise bereft of conscience, and he presides over the werebat tribe with iron-fisted resolve. As a rule, he does not treat with adventurers; he'd rather rob them and feed on their blood.JYMobar is the leader of the werebat group in Wyllowood, the figth level of Undermountain. r	mobar.png"

She looks like an old woman with two beholder eyestalks sprouting from her eye sockets. Her mouth, twice as large as it should be, is filled with sharp, pointed teeth. She wears the flayed, slippery, translucent skin of a kuo-toa as a cloak.

For years, the \Group{Legion of Azrok} left Preeta alone. Now the growing hostilities with the drow have prompted \NPC{Azrok} to call on her for help. Preeta understands the threat posed by the drow and is using \Spell{animate dead} spells to raise drow corpses, creating forces that \NPC{Azrok} can call upon to bolster his defenses.J‹Ex-apprentice Preeta, horribly transformed by \NCP{Arcturia}, now serves the \Group{Legion of Azrok} by animating drow corpses as soldiers.rpreeta kreepa.webp"ò

The \Monster{dragon} now refers to itself as \NPC{Tearulai} and has the longsword's neutral good alignment. It sleeps atop a platform overlooking the \Place{River of the Depths}, guarding its treasure.

\NPC{Wyllow} once set adventurers against \NPC{Valdemar}, hoping to destroy the evil \Monster{dragon}, but the \Monster{dragon}'s change of alignment caused \NPC{Wyllow} to reconsider their relationship. Now that \NPC{Valdemar} and \NPC{Tearulai} are one, the archdruid considers the \Monster{dragon} part of \Place{Wyllowwood}'s ecosystem. The two currently enjoy a peaceful coexistence.J‘Once an evil dragon slain by a magic sword, Tearulai is now a good-aligned guardian dragon coexisting peacefully with the archdruid \NPC{Wyllow}.rvaldemar.png"
