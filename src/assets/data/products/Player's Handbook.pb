Breath Weapon≠You can use your action to exhale destructive energy, ina 5 by 30 ft line. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

After you use your breath weapon, you can‚Äôt use it again until you com plete a short or long rest.˜

Deep GnomeGnome2Svirfneblin:ˆA third subrace of gnomes, the deep gnomes (or svirfneblin), live in small communities scattered in the \Place{Underdark}. Unlike the \Monster{duergar} and the \Monster{drow}, svirfneblin are as good as their surface cousins. However, their humor and enthusiasm are dampened by their oppressive environment, and their inventive expertise is directed mostly toward stonework.B4A subrace of gnomes living in the \Place{Underdark}.J$$R

Dragonborn:õBorn of \Monster{dragons}, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the \Monster{dragons} themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.\title{Proud Dragon Kin} Dragonborn look very much like \Monster{dragons} standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6 1/2 feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.

The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through som e dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor‚Äîbright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.\title{Self-Sufficient Clans} To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn‚Äôs conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.

A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the  self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push them selves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect o f a dragonborn.

Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races ‚Äî or even from the gods.BçProud Dragonborn are born from \Monster{dragons} and strive to be self-sufficient. They value skill and excellence and put their clans first.J !R

Dwarf:óBold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.

Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most com m on shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, w orn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.B_Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. JR

Gnome:ÉA constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their closeknit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.BqGnomes take delight in life, enjoying every momment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.J#%R

Half-Orc:¨Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, \Monster{orc} and \Monster{human} tribes sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Som e half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.B!The offspring of humans and orcs.J()R

Half-elf:’Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.B!The offspring of human and elves.J&'R

Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples.

Or maybe they feel they have som ething to prove to the elder races, and that‚Äôs why they build their mighty em pires on the foundation of conquest and trade.

	Warhammer:ﬁA warhammer is a type of weapon that consists of a heavy head with a spike or hammer face attached to a long handle. It is a popular weapon for both infantry and cavalry, and is used to crush armor, break shields, and deliver powerful blows.

Warhammers come in a variety of sizes and weights, but they typically weigh between 4 and 10 pounds and have a head that is about 12 to 18 inches long. The head of a warhammer can be made of iron, steel, or bronze, and it may be sharpened or blunt. The handle of a warhammer is typically made of wood or metal, and it is usually about 3 to 4 feet long.

Warhammers are typically used with two hands, and they are swung with a powerful overhead blow. The weight of the hammer helps to deliver a crushing blow, and the spike or hammer face can be used to puncture armor or break bones. Warhammers are also effective against unarmored opponents, as they can deliver powerful blows that can knock them to the ground.

Warhammers are a versatile weapon that can be used in a variety of situations. They are effective in close combat, and they can also be used to break down doors and fortifications. Warhammers are a popular weapon of choice for knights and warriors.

Here are some additional details about warhammers:\list{They were used by both infantry and cavalry.}{They were effective against armor, shields, and unarmored opponents.}{They could be used to break down doors and fortifications.}{They were a popular weapon of choice for knights and warriors.}BãA warhammer is a heavy, two-handed weapon with a spiked head or hammer face used to crush armor, break shields, and deliver powerful blows.JïïR

Alter Self:‘You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.

\em{\bold{Aquatic Adaptation.}} You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

\em{\bold{Change Appearance.}} You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can‚Äôt appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can‚Äôt use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.

Animal Messenger:‰By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a \Monster{squirrel}, a \Monster{blue jay}, or a \Monster{bat}. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as ‚Äúa man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard‚Äù or ‚Äúa red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.‚Äù You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 m iles for other animals.

When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave.

Animal Shapes:˛	Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.

The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target‚Äôs game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom , and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its norm al form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn‚Äôt reduce the creature‚Äôs normal form to 0 hit points, it isn‚Äôt knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can‚Äôt speak or cast spells.

The target‚Äôs gear melds into the new form. The target can‚Äôt activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.B©A druid's spell lets them transform willing creatures into beasts, gaining the beast's abilities but keeping their mind and suffering any leftover damage when reverting.J‘‘ *08R0Z

Animate Dead:Â
This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul m im icry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a \Monster{skeleton} if you chose bones or a \Monster{zombie} if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature‚Äôs game statistics).

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you‚Äôve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.BuThis spell raises undead servants, controlling them for 24 hours and reasserting control every 24 hours if necessary.J‘’ *08@J<A drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust.RZbGA pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range.j

Augury:‚By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.

The spell doesn‚Äôt take into account any possible circum stances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.

Bigby's Hand2Arcane Hand:øYou create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell‚Äôs duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn‚Äôt fill its space.

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.

\sub{Clenched Fist.} The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.

\sub{Forceful Hand.} The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand‚Äôs Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check o f the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.

\sub{Grasping Hand.} The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand‚Äôs Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

\sub{Interposing Hand.} The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand‚Äôs space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand‚Äôs Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand‚Äôs Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand‚Äôs space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.B9You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force.J⁄⁄ *08@J#An eggshell and a snakesking glove.R0Z

Contact Other Plane:ïYou mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest.

At the end of each of the target‚Äôs turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease‚Äôs effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.

Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease‚Äôs effects apply to it.\subtitle{Blinding Sickness.} Pain grips the creature‚Äôs mind, and its eyes turn milky white.

Control Water:ÑUntil the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\subtitle{Flood.} You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave‚Äôs path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\subtitle{Part Water.} You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell‚Äôs area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\subtitle{Redirect Flow.} You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell‚Äôs area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\subtitle{Whirlpool.} This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.

When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn‚Äôt caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.

The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.B„This spell allows you to control any freestanding water within a 100-foot cube and choose from various effects such as flooding an area, parting water to create a trench, redirecting the flow of water, or conjuring a whirlpool.J„‰ *08@J$A drop of water and a pinch of dust.R0Z

Delayed Blast Fireball:Ö	A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw.

If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw.

Detect Thoughts:ùFor the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn‚Äôt speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature ‚Äî what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature‚Äôs thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature‚Äôs mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature‚Äôs thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can‚Äôt see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can‚Äôt detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn‚Äôt speak any language.

Earthquake:ŒYou create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature‚Äôs concentration is broken.

When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

 This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.

\em{\bold{Fissures.}} Fissures open throughout the spell‚Äôs area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell‚Äôs area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure‚Äôs edge as it opens.

A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).

\em{\bold{Structures.}} The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure‚Äôs height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape.

Enlarge or Reduce2Enlarge/Reduce:ÛYou cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.

If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.\subtitle{Enlarge.} The target‚Äôs size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category ‚Äî from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn‚Äôt enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target‚Äôs weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target‚Äôs attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.\subtitle{Reduce.} The target‚Äôs size is halved in all dim ensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category ‚Äî from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target‚Äôs weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target‚Äôs attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can‚Äôt reduce the damage below 1).BfYou cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration.JÌÌ *08@JA pinch of iron powderR0Z

Gaseous Form:ÀYou transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it‚Äôs wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn‚Äôt affected.

While in this form, the target‚Äôs only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces.

Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.

The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.

Imprisonment:ßYou create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn‚Äôt age. Divination spells can‚Äôt locate or perceive the target.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.

\sub{Burial.} The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.

The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.

\sub{Chaining.} Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can‚Äôt move or be moved by any means until then.

The special com ponent for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.\sub{Hedged Prison.} The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.

The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.

\sub{Minimus Containment.} The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is im prisoned inside a gem stone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can‚Äôt be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.

The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.

\sub{Slumber.} The target falls asleep and can‚Äôt be awoken.

The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.

\sub{Ending the Spell.} During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature‚Äôs name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.

A \Spell{dispel magic} spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.

You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.BPYou create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range.J¸˝ 	*08@JœA  vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target.RZ b)A creature that you can see within range.j

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it w ere climbing.

You can‚Äôt create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a \Monster{troglodyte‚Äôs} stench).

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.BﬁThe spell creates a realistic illusion of an object or creature up to 20 feet in size that can be moved and altered, but can be revealed as an illusion through physical interaction or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.JÇÇ *08@JA bit of fleece.R0Z

Meld into Stone:ÌYou step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.

While merged with the stone, you can‚Äôt see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can‚Äôt move.

Minor physical damage to the stone doesn‚Äôt harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you.

If you create an image of an object ‚Äî such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest ‚Äî it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can‚Äôt create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

Mirror Image:¬Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it‚Äôs impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action todism iss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell‚Äôs duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack‚Äôs target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

A duplicate‚Äôs AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

Modify Memory:ÉYou attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becom es charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target‚Äôs m em ories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target‚Äôs memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature‚Äôs memory isn‚Äôt altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn‚Äôt necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature‚Äôs natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.

Otiluke's Resilient Sphere:ŒA sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.

Nothing ‚Äî not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects ‚Äî can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can‚Äôt be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere‚Äôs walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature‚Äôs speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

Phantasmal Force:ùYou craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall ‚Äî it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm‚Äôs reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm‚Äôs area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.BSCraft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature and can even damage it.Jàà *08@JA bit of fleece.R0Z

Plane Shift:ú
You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the \Place{City of Brass} on the \Place{Elemental Plane of Fire} or the palace of \Place{Dispater} on the second level of the \Place{Nine Hells}, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the \Place{City of Brass}, for example, you might arrive in its \Place{Street of Steel}, before its \Place{Gate of Ashes}, or looking at the city from across the \Place{Sea of Fire}, at the DM ‚Äôs discretion.

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.

You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify.

	Polymorph:∫
This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target‚Äôs (or the target‚Äôs level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target‚Äôs game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its norm al form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn‚Äôt reduce the creature‚Äôs normal form to 0 hit points, it isn‚Äôt knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can‚Äôt speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

Scrying:ê
You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it.

On a successful save, the target isn‚Äôt affected, and you can‚Äôt use this spell against it again for 24 hours.

On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell.

Simulacrum:ü	You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature‚Äôs hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates.

The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.

If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.

If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.BsShape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell.Jîî *08@JúSnow or ice in quantities sufficient to made a life-size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature‚Äôs body placed inside the snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell.RZ

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature‚Äôs hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points.

Slow:£You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target‚Äôs speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can‚Äôt use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature‚Äôs abilities or magic items, it can‚Äôt make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn‚Äôt take effect until the creature‚Äôs next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can‚Äôt, the spell is wasted.

Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn‚Äôt return the creature‚Äôs soul to its body, only its animating spirit.

Suggestion:ÁYou suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can‚Äôt be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be com pleted in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn‚Äôt met before the spell expires, the activity isn‚Äôt performed.

Teleport:ÙThis spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can‚Äôt be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d 100 and consults the table.

\table[Familiarity][Mishap][Similar Area][Off Target][On Target]{Permanent circle}{‚Äî}{‚Äî}{‚Äî}{01-100}{Associated object}{‚Äî}{‚Äî}{‚Äî}{01-100}{Very familiar}{01-05}{06-13}{14-24}{25-100}{Seen casually}{01-33}{34-43}{44-53}{54-100}{Viewed once}{01-43}{44-53}{54-73}{74-100}{Description}{01-43}{44-53}{54-73}{74-100}{False destination}{01-50}{51-100}{‚Äî}{‚Äî}\subtitle{Familiarity.} 'Permanent circle' means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. 'Associated object' means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard‚Äôs library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich‚Äôs secret tomb.

'Very familiar' is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. 'Seen casually' is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren‚Äôt very familiar. 'Viewed once' is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. 'Description' is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else‚Äôs description, perhaps from a map.

'False destination' is a place that doesn‚Äôt exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy‚Äôs sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\subtitle{On Target.} You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\subtitle{Off Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\subtitle{Similar Area.} You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that‚Äôs visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard‚Äôs laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\subtitle{Mishap.} The spell‚Äôs unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).B≥You can teleport yourself and others to a specific destination, but there is a chance of mishaps, such as being off-target, ending up in a similar area, or suffering force damage.Jôô *0R0ZbwYou and up to eight willing creatures that you can see withing range, or a single object that you can see within range.j

Teleportation Circle:€	As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed som ewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence ‚Äî a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.

You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year.

True Polymorph:›Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation becomes permanent.

Shapechangers aren‚Äôt affected by this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn‚Äôt affected by this spell.\subtitle{Creature into Creature.} If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target‚Äôs (or its level, if the target doesn‚Äôt have a challenge rating). The target‚Äôs game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn‚Äôt reduce the creature‚Äôs normal form to 0 hit points, it isn‚Äôt knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can‚Äôt speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless its new form is capable of such actions

The target‚Äôs gear melds into the new form. The creature can‚Äôt activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\subtitle{Object into Creature.} You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature‚Äôs size is no larger than the object‚Äôs size and the creature‚Äôs challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The DM has the creature‚Äôs statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.

If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.\subtitle{Creature into Object.} If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature‚Äôs statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its norm al form.B• You transform a creature or object into a different creature, object, or vice versa.

Wall of Fire:ˇYou create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.BzYou conjure a wall of fire that deals damage to creatures that touch it, enter it, or end their turn within 10 feet of it.Jùù *08@JA small piece of phosphorusR0Z

Wall of Force:ØAn invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature‚Äôs space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can‚Äôt be dispelled by \Spell{dispel magic}. A \Spell{disintegrate} spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the \Place{Ethereal Plane}, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.BUAn invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range.Jùù *08@J4A pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone.R0Z

Web:˙You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.

If the webs aren‚Äôt anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.BTYou conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. Jü† *08@JA bit of spiderweb.R0Z

	Wind Walk:öYou and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the \Action{Dash} action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can‚Äôt move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation. If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can‚Äôt land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.B¸The spell allows you and up to ten creatures to become gaseous clouds with flight speed of 300 feet and resistance to nonmagical weapons, but restricts actions to dashing or reverting to normal form, which takes 1 minute and incapacitates the creature.J†† *08@J RZ

	Wind Wall:∞A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.

 When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can‚Äôt pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can‚Äôt pass through it.BΩThe spell creates a wall of strong wind that can deal bludgeoning damage to creatures in its area, keep fog and smoke at bay, and block projectiles and small creatures from passing through.J†† *08@J*A tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin.R0Z

Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell‚Äôs area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can‚Äôt speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie.

Glyph of Warding2Warding, Glyph of:ÃWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place, if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.

You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.

\bold{\em{Explosive Runes:}} When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. The Sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the aura must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.

\bold{\em{Spell Glyph:}} You can store a prepared spell of 3rd Level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires Concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.B,Inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures.Jıˆ *08@JLIncense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumesRZ (b7Either a surface or within an object that can be closedjrñWhen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
