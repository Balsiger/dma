  description: "Qilueâ€™s second-in-command, and now leader of the \\Group{Promenade}, Iljrene is often mistaken for a soft, weak, naive girl. Those who make that mistake only do so once. She is gleeful, enthusiastic, kind, gentle, and lethal with a courtblade. Her divine magic, though not as powerful as that of \\NPC{Qilue}, is also a force to be reckoned with. However, she feels immensely inadequate as a leader. Others naturally compare her to \\NPC{Qilue}, a comparison to which she cannot live up."
