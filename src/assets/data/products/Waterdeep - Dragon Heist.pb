ûBlack ViperHuman2-
Waterdeep - Dragon Heist	WTC C4658ÄÄ:GenericBÎThe Black Viper was a notorious burglar, pickpocket, mugger, and assassin who died a century ago, after a long and nefarious career. Esvele Rosznar, a brash young noble, has recently adopted the Black Viper's persona to lead a secret life of crime. Like many other nobles, Esvele gossips about the Black Viper's exploits to lend credence to the villain's mystique.

The Rosznar family was convicted of slave trading - highly illegal in Waterdeep and banished over a hundred years ago, but has since returned. The Rosznars' inability to regain the respect they feel they deserve rankles them. The slave trade has continued in Amn and elsewhere, and it's not like other noble houses don't have skeletons in their closets. But just because of a little family squabble that went public, the \Group{Rosznar} name has been said with a sneer for a century. As part of the family's constant effort to prove this conception wrong and win others' respect, Esvele has been brought up to be the most proper noble possible, partaking in lessons of etiquette, dance, and poise as befits someone of her station.

In her younger days, Esvele openly rebelled, but that behavior led to locked doors at night and house guards watching her every move during the day. So she taught herself how to pick locks, pluck keys from belts and pouches, clamber up walls, and sneak past guards - playing the perfect daughter by day while cutting loose at night. To hide her identity from those she met, she wore a hood and mask, exchanging her fine clothes for the kind of practical clothing her parents would never let her wear.

One of the things Esvele has learned is to embrace the legend of the Black Viper. When she throws back her cloak to reveal the costume she has put together, most folk toss their purses and flee. If that doesn't work, she usually needs only to draw her dagger. Of course, some of the nobles she targets are made of sterner stuff, so Esvele has learned how to fight as well. She knows she's playing a dangerous game, but is satisfied that at least one member of the Rosznar family is earning the respect of Waterdeep's nobility.JJThe reincarnation of a notorious burgler, pickpocket, mugger and assassin.rblack viper.webp(8J (0Zbš

Waterdeep - Dragon Heist	WTC C4658ÎÎ:GenericBÍJarlaxle is a flamboyant, swashbuckling drow iconoclast. He leads a renegade \Monster{drow} faction called \Group{Bregan D'aerthe}, made up of disenfranchised male drow, most of them culled from destroyed or disgraced houses. Gifted with a sharp mind, a sense of humor, puissant s kill with a blade, and a wealth of useful magic items, Jarlaxle infiltrated the city of Luskan, brought a kind of order to its lawlessness, and declared himself its secret lord.

Jarlaxle likes to weave a tangled web of schemes that leave his enemies baffled - the latest of which is a plan to legitimize Luskan by making it a member of the Lords' Alliance. The city's unsavory reputation has thwarted all previous efforts, and the current leaders of the Lords' Alliance have voiced their opposition to Luskan's admittance. A few have flatly declared that the city will never be welcome in the alliance. Nonetheless, Jarlaxle aims to persuade \NPC{Laeral Silverhand}, the Open Lord of \Place{Waterdeep}, to champion Luskan's cause even if that means losing other alliance members in the process. Tying \Place{Luskan}'s fortunes to those of \Place{Waterdeep} would increase Jarlaxle's political and economic power on the \Place{Sword Coast}.

Jarlaxle has come to \Place{Waterdeep} in the guise of an llluskan human named \NPC{Zardoz Zord}. 'Captain Zord' is the master of the \Group{Sea Maidens Faire}, a carnival that travels up and down the Sword Coast in three ships: the \em{Eyecatcher}. the \em{Heartbreaker}, and the \em{Hellraiser} (all words that describejarlaxle). He spends most of his time aboard the Eyecatcher, his personal ship. The other two vessels carry members of the carnival and their parade wagons.

Jarlaxle has forged an alliance with \Place{Lantan} (an island to the south), and has armed his \Group{Bregan D'aerthe} lieutenants with Lantanese firearms that rely on magical smokepowder to function. He has also acquired a Lantanese submarine called the \em{Scarlet Marpenoth}. This underwater vessel is mounted below the \em{Eyecatcher} and kept out of sight. Jarlaxle plans on using the submarine to flee \Place{Waterdeep} if his scheme unravels.

The original \NPC{Manshoon} was one of the founders of the \Group{Zhentarim}. Evil to the core, he made enemies all across  \Place{FaertÃ»n}, including other powerful spellcasters such as \NPC{Khelben Arunsun} and \NPC{Elminster}. Fearing that he might be destroyed by his foes, \NPC{Manshoon} magically crafted several clones - but a mishap caused all of them to be awakened at once, whereupon they tried to destroy one another in a series of conflicts that came to be known as the \Event{Manshoon Wars}.

Now the original \NPC{Manshoon} is dead, and it's widely believed that all his clones were destroyed as well. In fact, at least three are still alive. The one presently in \Place{Waterdeep} escaped death by hiding out in \Place{Undermountain}, where he eventually ran afoul of \NPC{Halaster Blackcloak}. After a brief spell duel, \NPC{Halaster} captured \NPC{Manshoon} and amputated his left arm at the elbow for reasons unknown. \NPC{Manshoon} escaped imprisonment and fled \Place{Undermountain}, taking refuge in the city above. Attempts to magically regenerate his severed limb failed, forcing him to craft an artificial arm and hand for himself.

\NPC{Manshoon} took control of \Place{Kolat Towers}, a crumbling residence in the \Place{Southern Ward} that was abandoned years ago by the two wizards who built it.

Orond is the patriarch, but he's not a quick-think-ing or cultured sort - and deep down, he knows it. He leaves most of the plotting and socializing to his wife, \NPC{Yalah}, to whom he is devoted.

When several of the \Group{Masked Lords} were assassinated in quick succession some years ago. Lord Gralhund had expected his wife to fill one of the vacancies. That never happened, though, despite many promises and bribes. After she was passed over, Orond became insanely angry, and he has remained that way ever since.

Less than a year ago, the Gralhunds were approached by agents of the \Group{Zhentarim} loyal lo \NPC{Manshoon}, and the nobles formed an alliance with them. House Gralhund gives the Zhents coin and allows them to use the family's noble villa as a refuge. In exchange, the house reaps all the benefits that the Black Network offers, including intelligence that its spies have gathered. So while the Zhents use House Gralhund as a shield, the Gralhunds are using the Zhenls to ascertain the identities and weaknesses of the Masked Lords.

Orond doesn't fully grasp how entwined the Black Network and his family have become it is now next to impossible to separate one from the other. lfs no secret in Waterdeep that the Black Network has firmly rooted itself in House Gralhund. But what's not generally known is thal the Zhents in House Gralhund are agents of Manshoon. Neither Orond nor any other member of his family knows about the wizard's clone. As far as Orond and his wife are concerned, the local leaders of the Black Network (with \NPC{Urstul Floxin} chief among them) reside with them in the family villa.

Orond is a short, stocky man who dresses well and is easy on the eyes. When he opens his mouth, his boorish nature, inflated sense of self-importance, fragile ego, and despicable opinions about 'the common rabble' come to the fore, and his charm quickly dissipates. When not in his wife's company, he is prone to excessive boasting and temper tantrums. When he must speak to strangers, he keeps his half-orc bodyguard \NPC{Hrabbaz} close by, for fear that others might attack and rob him at any moment. While in Yalah's presence, Orond becomes an altogether different person: quiet, almost timid, and happy to let his wife have the spotlight.

Orond relies on Yalah to manage the Zhentarim. He spends his days watching mercenaries train, paying bills, and ranting about the cost of doing business in the city. Although he is human, Orond was born with a tiefling's tail. The tail was amputated when he was a young boy, but the scar on his backside remains.J¦House Gralhund, a power-hungry noble family, uses the Zhentarim criminal network to gain intel on rivals while being unknowingly manipulated by a hidden Zhent leader.rorond gralhund.jpg(J	š

The lord of House Cassalanter is a devilishly handsome half-elf who likes coin and power. He and his wife gained both by cutting a deal with Asmodeus - which involved trading away the souls of their three children.

Victoro is a priest of \God{Asmodeus}, though his devotion to the Lord of the Nine Hells is a secret known only to his wife and his closest friends. Most Waterdavians know him as a successful banker, philanthropist, and worshiper of \God{Lathander}. Some of his business profits go toward feeding and sheltering the poor. But behind this veneer of generosity, Victoro is a self-serving beast.

The soul of Victoro's eldest son, \NCP{Osvaldo}, is forever lost and can't be saved. To allay his guilt. Victoro has forged a plan to win back the souls of his young twins, \NPC{Terenzio} and \NPC{Elzerina}.

Waterdeep - Dragon Heist	WTC C4658ÜÜ:GenericB·Xanathar is the name given to the beholder crime lord that lives in the dungeons under \Place{Waterdeep}. It isn't the first \Monster{beholder} to claim this mantle, nor will it be the last.

Like all beholders, Xanathar is a paranoid tyrant that charms and bullies its minions into servitude. The \Group{Xanathar Guild} is made up of some of Waterdeep's most disreputable folk, as well as monsters forced into subservience or drawn to the beholder by the promise of treasure, food, or power. Treachery within the ranks of the guild is common as servants vie for the beholder's favor and affection. Such boons are fleeting, though, as the beholder is quick to distrust those who finagle their way into its good graces.

Xanathar lives in a dungeon under \Place{Skullport}, a subterranean settlement connected to \Place{Undermountain}'s third level. The place resembles a ramshackle town, built inside a giant cavern connected to an underground river. Members of the Xanathar Guild haunt Skullport's dilapidated buildings, and \Monster[flameskull]{flameskulls} patrol its streets.

The only creature Xanathar truly cares about aside from itself is a fish, named \NPC{Sylgar}, that it keeps in a large glass tank. Xanathar has minions that look after the fish constantly, but even their ministracions can't keep such a creature alive forever. Whenever the fish dies, panic spreads through the occupants of the lair as minions try to replace the fish before Xanathar realizes what has happened. Luckily for them, the beholder can't tell one fish from another.

Xanathar is extremely fond of gold. A few years ago, its spies stole the \Item{Stone of Golorr}, which contained information that led to the discovery of a dwarven vault under \Place{Waterdeep}. Xanathar was able to open the vault, but was forced out by the dragon inside the place. Recently. someone stole the \Item{Stone of Golorr} from where it was hidden inside its lair, and the beholder is convinced that the \Group{Black Network} is behind the theft.

The beholder is caught up in the unbreakable grip of its own paranoia. It sees enemies everywhere. and lashes out at anyone it suspects of being a \Group{Zhentarim} spy or assassin. Adventurers who attract its attention by dealing with known or suspected \Group{Black Network} operatives are quickly branded as enemies that must be destroyed.J7The \Monster{beholder} crime lord of \Place{Waterdeep}.rxanathar.webpâRing of invisibilityâRing of mind shieldingâRing of force resistance¯

Yalah stays abreast of events in the city, keeps a tight rein on her children, and uses her station and her family's wealth to pry secrets from the lips of nobles, guildmasters, and commoners alike. Though her previous attempts to become a Masked Lord have been thwarted, she believes it's only a matter of time until that honor is bestowed on her. Once she knows the identities and secrets of enough Masked Lords, Yalah is confident that she can bribe, blackmail, or extort her way into their ranks. From there, she plans to effect changes in the government that will ensure House Gralhund's prosperity for generations to come.

Yalah shares the services of a half-ore bodyguard with her husband, although \NPC{Hrabbaz} (see page 205) is more loyal to her than to him. She also uses the Zhentarim who are based in House Gralhund as her personal spy network, not realizing that the Zhents' true master is Manshoon.

The original \NPC{Manshoon} was one of the founders of the \Group{Zhentarim}. Evil to the core, he made enemies all across  \Place{FaertÃ»n}, including other powerful spellcasters such as \NPC{Khelben Arunsun} and \NPC{Elminster}. Fearing that he might be destroyed by his foes, \NPC{Manshoon} magically crafted several clones - but a mishap caused all of them to be awakened at once, whereupon they tried to destroy one another in a series of conflicts that came to be known as the \Event{Manshoon Wars}.

Now the original \NPC{Manshoon} is dead, and it's widely believed that all his clones were destroyed as well. In fact, at least three are still alive. The one presently in \Place{Waterdeep} escaped death by hiding out in \Place{Undermountain}, where he eventually ran afoul of \NPC{Halaster Blackcloak}. After a brief spell duel, \NPC{Halaster} captured \NPC{Manshoon} and amputated his left arm at the elbow for reasons unknown. \NPC{Manshoon} escaped imprisonment and fled \Place{Undermountain}, taking refuge in the city above. Attempts to magically regenerate his severed limb failed, forcing him to craft an artificial arm and hand for himself.

\NPC{Manshoon} took control of \Place{Kolat Towers}, a crumbling residence in the \Place{Southern Ward} that was abandoned years ago by the two wizards who built it. The edifice is surrounded by a magical barrier that has the properties of a wall of force. \NPC{Manshoon} rarely leaves the towers and uses a teleportation circle when he must do so, and thus is never seen entering or leaving. \NPC{Manshoon} aims to rule \Place{Waterdeep} and replace the \Group{City Watch} with \Group{Black Network} mercenaries that are loyal to him alone. By bribing and blackmailing the \Group{Masked Lords}, he hopes to oust \NPC{Laeral Silverhand} as \NPC{Open Lord} and take her place, kill the \NPC{Blackstaff}, reduce the \Group{Masked Lords} to mere vassals, and declare himself the Wizard-King of \Place{Waterdeep}. Once the city is firmly in his clutches, Manshoon will then turn his attention toward \Place{Undermountain}, destroy \NPC{Halaster} once and for all, and claim the dungeon's riches.J"A clone of the ancient archwizard.rmanshoon.webp"´

Waterdeep - Dragon Heist	WTC C4658¿¿:GenericBíThis bright plume is made from the feather of a diatryma (pronounced dee-ah-TRY-mah), a Large, colorful, flightless bird native to the Underdark. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the feather into a Large unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you, the feather becomes a living \Monster{diatryma} for up to 6 hours, after which it reverts to its feather form. It reverts to feather form early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching the bird.

When the diatryma reverts to feat her form, the magic of the feather can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

The diatryma uses the statistics of an \bold{axe beak}, except that its beak deals piercing damage instead of slashing damage. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it can be used as a mount. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the diatryma defends itself but takes no other actions.JSummon an diatryma.08jFeatherx:™
