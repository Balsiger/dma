  description: "This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and create a harmless burst of multicolored light at a point you can see up to 60 feet away. The burst of light is accompanied by a crackling noise that can be heard up to 300 feet away. The light is as bright as a torch flame but lasts only a second.\n\nThe wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. Ifyou expend the wandâ€™s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand erupts in a harmless pyrotechnic display and is destroyed."
