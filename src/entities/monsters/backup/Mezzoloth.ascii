  description: "The bulk of the \\Monster{yugoloth} population is made up of mezzoloths, which are human-sized insect creatures covered in dense chitinous plates. Mezzoloths serve as foot soldiers in \\Monster{yugoloth} armies, their wide-set eyes glowing red as the mezzoloths bear down on their foes.\n\nViolence and reward are the fundamental drives of a mezzoloth, and powerful beings that promise one or the other can easily attract them into service. Although it has lethal claws on its four arms, a mezzoloth typically wields a trident in two of them. If surrounded by enemies, a mezzoloth exhales toxic fumes that can Â· choke and kill whole groups of creatures."
