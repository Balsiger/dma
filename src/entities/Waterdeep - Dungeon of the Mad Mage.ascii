    description: "A common magic item to which anyone can attune. While holding the staff, a creature can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of it, or from the staff itself. Unless a specific kind of flower is chosen, the staff creates a mild-scented daisy. Wyllow's staff is peculiar in that it can't create roses, which the archdruid dislikes. If a rose is chosen, a daisy grows instead. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would.\n\nThe staff has 10 charges and regains ld6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If its last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns into black rose petals and is lost forever."

It can cast its spells with verbal or somatic components in its new form.\n\nThe new form's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks."

    description: "Wyllow is a \\Monster{moon elf} druid with eyes as green as emeralds. Butterflies nest in her tangled black hair, and small critters gather around her feet.\n\nOver two hundred years ago, Wyllow fell in love with \\NPC{Yinark}, a wizard in league with Halaster, and returned with him to \\Place{Undermountain}. Her happiness faded quickly when the dungeon proved to be a far cry from the woods she called home. Determined to keep Wyllow in \\Place{Undermountain}, \\NPC{Halaster} used several wish spells to create a magical forest for her, but even this gift wasn't enough to offset the druid's languor. When \\NPC{Yinark} forbade her from ever returning to the surface, Wyllow grew positively despondent. The relationship soured and turned violent. A volley of spells on both sides resulted in \\NPC{Yinark}'s death. After Wyllow's fury abated, all that remained was undying grief and encroaching madness. She remains in \\Place{Undermountain} in accordance with \\NPC{Yinark}'s wishes, a prisoner of her own guilt.\n\n\\Place{Undermountain} is Wyllow's home now, and all memory of the surface world has faded from her mind. She is distant but kind toward those who pass harmlessly through her domain, but turns violent whenever her forest or its peaceful denizens are threatened. Before setting out to destroy interlopers, she rallies the \\Monster{green dragon} and the \\Monster{werebats}, using them to soften up her adversaries. She can also summon six \\Monster{awakened trees} from the forest with a whistle.\n\nWyllow's \\Monster{displacer beast} companion, Crissann, is named after a \\Monster{human} mercenary whom the \\Monster{elf} befriended many years ago. Before this friendship could blossom into a romance, \\NPC{Halaster} intervened and used his magic to turn Wyllow's new friend against her. The heartbroken druid slew \\NPC{Crissann} in the woods with the help of several forest creatures and vowed never to let another mortal touch her heart so deeply.\n\nWyllow has conflicted feelings about \\NPC{Halaster}. She is grateful to him for providing her a home and keeping \\Place{Wyllowwood} alive with his magic, but she blames him for \\NPC{Yinark}'s death. She also pities him, for the \\NPC{Mad Mage} too appears to be trapped in a prison of his own making. Wyllow believes he is no longer \\Monster{human}, but an immortal entity composed of pure magic. Thus, she has given up any hope of being rid of him."

    notes: "Green Slime: This acidic slime devours flesh , organic material, and metal on contact. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches. A patch of green slime covers a 5-foot square, has blindsight out to a range of 30 feet, and drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement below it. Beyond that, it has no ability to move. A creature aware of the slime's presence can avoid being struck by it with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the slime can't be avoided as it drops. A creature that comes into contact  with green slime takes 5 (1d10) acid damage. The creature takes the damage again at the start of each of its turns until the slime is scraped off or destroyed. Against wood or metal, green slime deals 11 (2d10) acid damage each round, and any nonmagical wood or metal weapon or tool used to scrape off the slime is effectively destroyed. Sunlight, any effect that cures disease, and any effect that deals cold, fire, or radiant damage destroys a patch of green slime."
