«Manshoon (Clone)2-
Waterdeep - Dragon Heist	WTC C4658––:GenericB»Referred to in this adventure simply as 'Manshoon', this clone of the ancient archwizard infiltrated \Place{Waterdeep} years ago and has been hiding out in \Place{Kolat Towers} ever since, in the city's \Place{Southern Ward}.

The original \NPC{Manshoon} was one of the founders of the \Group{Zhentarim}. Evil to the core, he made enemies all across  \Place{Faert√ªn}, including other powerful spellcasters such as \NPC{Khelben Arunsun} and \NPC{Elminster}. Fearing that he might be destroyed by his foes, \NPC{Manshoon} magically crafted several clones - but a mishap caused all of them to be awakened at once, whereupon they tried to destroy one another in a series of conflicts that came to be known as the \Event{Manshoon Wars}.

Now the original \NPC{Manshoon} is dead, and it's widely believed that all his clones were destroyed as well. In fact, at least three are still alive. The one presently in \Place{Waterdeep} escaped death by hiding out in \Place{Undermountain}, where he eventually ran afoul of \NPC{Halaster Blackcloak}. After a brief spell duel, \NPC{Halaster} captured \NPC{Manshoon} and amputated his left arm at the elbow for reasons unknown. \NPC{Manshoon} escaped imprisonment and fled \Place{Undermountain}, taking refuge in the city above. Attempts to magically regenerate his severed limb failed, forcing him to craft an artificial arm and hand for himself.

\NPC{Manshoon} took control of \Place{Kolat Towers}, a crumbling residence in the \Place{Southern Ward} that was abandoned years ago by the two wizards who built it. The edifice is surrounded by a magical barrier that has the properties of a wall of force. \NPC{Manshoon} rarely leaves the towers and uses a teleportation circle when he must do so, and thus is never seen entering or leaving. \NPC{Manshoon} aims to rule \Place{Waterdeep} and replace the \Group{City Watch} with \Group{Black Network} mercenaries that are loyal to him alone. By bribing and blackmailing the \Group{Masked Lords}, he hopes to oust \NPC{Laeral Silverhand} as \NPC{Open Lord} and take her place, kill the \NPC{Blackstaff}, reduce the \Group{Masked Lords} to mere vassals, and declare himself the Wizard-King of \Place{Waterdeep}. Once the city is firmly in his clutches, Manshoon will then turn his attention toward \Place{Undermountain}, destroy \NPC{Halaster} once and for all, and claim the dungeon's riches.J"A clone of the ancient archwizard.rmanshoon.png"¥
