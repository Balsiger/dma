SpellcastingáThe archdruid is a 12-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom. It has the following druid spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): \Spell{druidcraft}, \Spell{mending}, \Spell{poison spray}, \Spell{produce flame}

1st level (4 slots): \Spell{cure wounds}, \Spell{entangle}, \Spell{faerie fire}, \Spell{speak with animals}

2nd level (3 slots): \Spell{animal messenger}, \Spell{beast sense}, \Spell{hold person}

3rd level (3 slots): \Spell{conjure animals}, \Spell{meld into stone}, \Spell{water breathing}

4th level (3 slots): \Spell{dominate beast}, \Spell{locate creature}, \Spell{stoneskin}, \Spell{wall of fire}

5th level (3 slots): \Spell{commune with nature}, \Spell{mass cure wounds}, \Spell{tree stride}

6th level (1 slot): \Spell{heal}, \Spell{sunbeam}¬›
Change Shape (2/Day)ƒThe archdruid magically polymorphs into a beast or elemental with a challenge rating of 4 or less, and can remain in this form for up to 6 hours. The archdruid can choose whether its equipment falls to the ground, melds with its new form, or is worn by the new form. The archdruid reverts to its true form if it dies or falls unconscious. The archdruid can revert to its true form using a bonus action on its turn. While in a new form, the archdruid retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, and Dexterity are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any special senses, proficiencies, traits, actions, and reactions (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. It can cast its spells with verbal or somatic components in its new form.

The new form's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks.⁄

It contains an enchantment that allows all the commonly used tool-sets by the attuned wearer, and provides those tools at no additional weight. When the wearer is attuned, the wearer is considered proficient with all tools provided by the belt. However, the belt does not provide double-proficiency if the wearer is already proficient with certain tools. The tools provided by this belt include:\list{Alchemist's Supplies}{Brewer's Supplies}{Calligrapher's Supplies}{Carpenter's Tools}{Cartographer's Tools}{Cobbler's Tools}{Cook's Utensils}{Glassblower's Tools}{Jeweler's Tools}{Leatherworker's Tools}{Mason's Tools}{Painter's Supplies}{Potter's Tools}{Smith's Tools}{Tinker's Tools}{Weaver's Tools}{Woodcarver's Tools}{Disguise Kit}{Forgery Kit}{Herbalism Kit}{Navigator's Tools}{Poisoner's Kit}{Thieves' Tools}.BìThis magical tool belt contains a variety of tools and grants the wearer proficiency with all of them, making it a valuable tool for any craftsman.J08b

Halaster's Instant FortressHalaster's Instant Fortresses:ØYou can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty. It takes ten minutes for the fortress to grow from a one-inch cube to it's full size.

While \Item{Daern's Instant Fortress} is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Halaster's improvement on that infamous magical device is 100ft on a side and 60ft high. It has no arrow slits, but it does have a battlement surrounding the second floor.

Its interior is divided into two floors, with a double staircase to connect them. When activated, the tower has a double door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the \Spell{knock} spell and similar magic, such as that of a \Item{chime of opening}. The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a \Spell{wish} spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.B’This magic item is a cube that can be used to summon a large, heavily fortified castle that is resistant to damage and has a double door that can only be opened by the user.
