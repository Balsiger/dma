Lair Trait: Turning ProtectionåMonsters in the tomb have advantage on saving throws against being \Condition{charmed} or \Condition{frightened}, and against features that turn undead. If the demilich is destroyed, these effects fade over the course of 10 days.Â‹
Howl (Recharge 5-6)óThe demilich emits a bloodcurdling howl. Each creature within 30 feet of the demilich that can hear the howl must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and the creature is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes no damage and is immune to being frightened until the end of its next turn.Ò­
ùThe demilich can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The demilich regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.9
Flight/The demilich flies up to half its flying speed.ç
Cloud of DustÕThe demilich magically swirls its dusty remains. Each creature within 10 feet of the demilich, including around a corner, must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of the demilich's next turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this effect until the end of the demilich's next turn.E
