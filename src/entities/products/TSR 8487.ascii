  description: "The \\Group{Red Wizards} rule \\Place{Thay}, perhaps the most wicked and corrupt land in all the \\Place{Forgotten Realms}. While the evil mage, \\NPC{Zulkir Maligor}, builds a net of treachery and deceit, the \\Group{Harpers} seek to uncover his vile schemes. A small band is sent by the \\Group{Harpers} to pose as slaves and slavers to infiltrate the malevolent land. Once inside \\Place{Thay}, they face undead minions of the \\Group{Red Wizards} and a future far worse than death: becoming the wizard\'s soulless puppets! \\Product{Red Magic} is the third in an open-ended series of novels focusing on the \\Group{Harpers}, the secret organization for Good in the Product{Forgotten Realms} fantasy world."
