Brown Mold:≠Brown mold is a dungeon hazard, not a real monster. Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from anything around it. A patch of brown mold typically covers a 10-foot square, and the temperature within 30 feet of it is always frigid.

When a creature moves to within 5 feet of the mold for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Brown mold is immune to fire, and any source of fire brought within 5 feet of a patch causes it to instantly expand outward in the direction of the fire, covering a 10-foot-square area (with the source of the fire at the center of that area). A patch of brown mold exposed to an effect that deals cold damage is instantly destroyed.B3Brown mold is a dungeon hazard, not a real monster.JiiR

Alchemy Jug:⁄This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.

You can use an action and name one liquid from the table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as an action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named.

Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.\table[Liquid][Max Amount]{Acid}{8 ounces}{Oil 1 quart}{Basic poison}{1/2 ounce}{Vinegar}{2 gallons}{Beer}{4 gallons}{Water, fresh}{8 gallons}{Honey}{1 gallon}{Water, salt}{12 gallons}{Mayonnaise}{2 gallons}{Wine}{1 gallon}BÓThis magic jug can produce a variety of liquids, such as acid, honey, mayonnaise, poison, oil, vinegar, fresh or salt water, wine, ammonia, aqua regia, beer, chlorine, and cyanide. The jug can produce up to 2 gallons of liquid per minute.JññR

Apparatus of Kwalish:¢This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.

The apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the following statistics:



\bold{Armor Class:} 20

\bold{Hit Points:} 200

\bold{Speed:} 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)

\bold{Damage Immunities:} poison, psychic



To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

 The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.

A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.



\table[Lever][Up][Down]{1}{Legs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim}{Legs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus's speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed}{2}{Forward window shutter opens.}{Forward window shutter closes.}{3}{Side window shutters open (two per side)}{Side window shutters close (two per side).}{4}{Two claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus.}{The claws retract.}{5}{Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hi, reach 5ft., one target.

Bag of Holding:œ	This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the \Place{Astral Plane}. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a \Item{Heward's handy haversack}, \Item{portable hole}, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the \Place{Astral Plane}. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the \Place{Astral Plane}. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.BOThis bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions.JôöR%

If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.B“A figurine of wondrous power is a small statuette that can be thrown to summon a living creature that obeys your commands.

Folding Boat:†	This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring you to use an action to speak it.

One command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.

The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide; and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures omfortably.

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.

The third command word causes the folding boat to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.BwThis magical wooden box can unfold into a 10-foot boat or a 24-foot ship, and can fold back into a box when not in use.J™´R!

Ioun Stone:ÈAn Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.

When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of ld3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.BAn Ioun stone is a magical object that orbits a creature's head, providing a beneficial effect. The stone can be removed by another creature by making an attack roll or Acrobatics check, or by the creature wearing it seizing and stowing it.J∞±8jStonex:w

The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.

Portable Hole:ﬁThis fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be u ed to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.

You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, Heward's handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the \Place{Astral Plane}. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the \Place{Astral Plane}. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.B"A hole that can be carried around.JπªR#

Spell ScrollScroll:÷A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell's components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.

If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.\table[Spell Level][Rarity][Save DC][Attack Bonus]{Cantrip}{Common}{13}{+5}{1st}{Common}{13}{+5}{2nd}{Uncommon}{13}{+5}{3rd}{Uncommon}{15}{+7}{4th}{Rare}{15}{+7}{5th}{Rare}{17}{+9}{6th}{Very rare}{17}{+9}{7th}{Very rare}{18}{+10}{8th}{Very rare}{18}{+10}{9th}{Legendary}{19}{+11} A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check ucceeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.BñA spell scroll contains a single spell and can be read to cast the spell without providing any materials.

Staff of PowerQuarterstaff	Weapon +2Staff:ÜThis staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2 charges.

\sub{Power Strike.} When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.

\sub{Spells.} While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: \Spell{cone of cold} (5 charges), \Spell{fireball} (5th-level version, 5 charges), \Spell{globe of invulnerability} (6 charges), \Spell{hold monster} (5 charges), \Spell{levitate} (2 charges), \Spell{lightning bolt} (5th-level version, 5 charges), \Spell{magic missile} (1 charge), \Spell{ray of enfeeblement} (1 charge), or \Spell{wall of force} (5 charges).

\sub{Retributive Strike.} You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 x the number of charges in the taff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw.

Staff of the AdderQuarterstaff:îYou can use a bonus action to speak this staff's command word and make the head of the staff become that of an animate poisonous snake for 1 minute. By using another bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the staff to its normal inanimate form.

You can make a melee attack using the snake head, which has a reach of 5 feet. Your proficiency bonus applies to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 poison damage.

The snake head can be attacked while it is animate. It has an Armor Class of 15 and 20 hit points. If the head drops to 0 hit points, the staff is destroyed. As long as it's not destroyed, the staff regains all lost hit points when it reverts to its inanimate form.B=A staff that can transform into a snake with a poison attack.JÀÀR-

The staff becomes a \Monster{giant constrictor snake} under your control and acts on its own initiative count. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the staff to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by the snake.

On your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren't \Condition{incapacitated}. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its staff form. The staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing all its hit points, it regains all of them.BQThe staff can turn into a giant constrictor snake that can be mentally commanded.JÃÃR/

Staff:áA magic staff is about 5 or 6 feet long. Staffs vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. Depending on the material, a staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds.

Unless a staff's description says otherwise, a staff can be used as a quarterstaff.BèMagic staffs are about 5 or 6 feet long and can be used as a quarterstaff. They vary in appearance and material and may have special abilities.JååR

Stone of Golorr:ÿThe Stone of Golorr is a glossy, greenish-gray stone that fits in the palm of your hand. The stone is actually an \Monster{aboleth} named \NPC{Golorr}, transformed by magic into an object.

\em{\bold{Legend Lore.}} The Stone of Golorr has 3 charges and regains ld3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the stone, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the legend lore spell.

By using the stone to cast legend lore, you communicate directly with the aboleth, and it shares its knowledge with you. The aboleth can't lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.

The aboleth koows where Lord Neverember's secret vault is located. It also knows that three keys are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon named Aurinax (red dragon instead?) inhabits the vault and guards its treasures.

\em{\bold{Failed Memory.}} When your attunement to the Stone of Colorr ends, you must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving  throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A remove curse spell cast on you has a 20 percent chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a \Spell{greater restoration} spell does so automatically.

\em{\bold{Sentience.}} The Stone of Golorr is a sentient lawful evil magic ilem with an Intelligence or 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. In addition, the aboleth learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.

The Stone of Golorr hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see 'Sentient Magic Items' in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

\em{\bold{Personality.}} The Stone ofGolorr has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god.

\em{\bold{Destroying the Stone.}} While in stone form, the aboleth isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Golorr is immune to all damage. Casting an \Spell{antipathy/sympathy} spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and \NCP{Golorr} the \Monster{aboleth} appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see.

\em{\bold{Eyes.}} The stone has three eyes that can be removed. If the stone is blinded, it is inert. With one eye restored, the Stone can communicate, but still not see the secrets it once contained. With 2 eyes restored, the Stone (and a character attuned to it) can now 'see' the location of the remaining Eye and the immediate area around it. With all 3 Eyes restored, the Stone is fully restored and operates normally again.B6A greenish-gray stone of tremendous power of the mind.J¿¿R0

The target can be a creature, an object, or a point in space. Roll dlOO and consult the following table to discover what happens.

If the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, the spell's save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its range becomes 120 feet if it isn't already.

If an effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include the target. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the DM randomly determines which ones are affected.
