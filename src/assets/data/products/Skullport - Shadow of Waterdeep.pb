Elkantar IluimDrowBÙElkantar, the former consort of Qilue Veladorn, is still grieving her death and has lost his faith in Eilistraee. He wields a greatsword and focuses on the security of the Promenade to distract himself from his guilt.:ÆElkantar was the consort of \NPC{Qilue Veladorn}, the previous head of the Chosen of Eilistraee. When \NPC{Qilue} died, Elkantar fell into a heavy bout of depression from which he has not yet recovered. He no longer performs, and takes no great pleasure in life anymore. He does not participate in dances to the goddess, and his faith has been on the wane. In the words of \NPC{Iljrene}, the Song has gone quiet within him. He gets by, day-to-day, and focuses on the security of the \Place{Promenade} to distract himself from his guilt over not being there to save \NPC{Qilue}. He wields one of the twelve \Item{Singing Swords} gifted to the Chosenâ€”a heavy greatsword which he swings with impressive finesse.J>?R$

Lesser Raggamoffyn2TatterdemanimalB§Raggamoffyns are sentient creatures made of discarded materials that can control hosts. They can recreate their kind, but only with the help of a host and magic items.:Û\title{Description} Raggamoffyns disguise themselves as items made from the material they are composed of. Examples include cloaks, capes, piles of rags, and metallic shrapnel. If possessing a host they appear as humans in dim light and are often mistaken for \Monster{adherers} or \Monster{mummies} in brighter light.\title{Combat} All raggamoffyns attempt to envelop potential victims in order to control them. If successful, the parts of the raggamoffyn cling to the victim in a skin-tight sheath from head to toe. The raggamoffyn usually creat a hood to cover the victim's face as well. Once enveloped, a victim is forced to do the raggamoffyn's bidding until the creature is done with them or they are able to resist the creature's control.\title{Society}These creatures can not speak but they understand the Common tongue. All raggamoffyns are driven to create more of their kind, but a host is required to do so. The host is enveloped and forced to destroy magic items while the raggamoffyn performs a silent rite that mysteriously creates a new raggamoffyn. The host is usually not directly harmed during this process, though the raggamoffyn often forces them to commit crimes in order to attain magic items, the result of which could lead to the hosts getting harmed.

Aside from \Monster{gutterspites}, the other forms of raggamoffyn can not possess \Monster{gnomes} or \Monster{duergar}.\title{History} The exact origin of these creatures remains unclear. Some believe them to be remnants of magic items that were discarded. Others believe the \NPC{Rag Mage} was creating them using a cursed \Item{Manual of golems}.JCCR&

Rag MageRag MagelichBÆThe Rag Mage is a mysterious creature related to the \Group{Thirteen} Skulls who uses \Monster{raggamoffyns} to scare and control people, and is concerned with the preservation of \Place{Skullport}.:µA mysterious boogeyman in \Place{Skullport}, the Rag Mage is thought to be in some way connected to the \Group{Thirteen Skulls}. Some even theorize that he may be a mysterious fourteenth. Whatever the nature of his existence, \Group{Skulkers} are always mindful whenever bits of cloth or trash suddenly float up and seem to dance in an invisible wind. Many believe this to be the work of his fearsome \Monster{raggamoffyns}. These creatures are creations of the Rag Mage, composed from litter, refuse, and rubbish tossed in the streets of Skullport. They can be as small as a kitten or as large as a person, and are exceptionally dangerous tricksters, who love to smother and take control of those who donâ€™t show the proper respect.

The Rag Mageâ€™s first and foremost concern is with the preservation of \Place{Skullport}, and the \Item{Mantle} which supports it. All else is secondary, and no life is precious to him that does not further this.JBCR

Visceral Threads (Recharge 5-6)ÍThe Rag Mage chooses any number of foes within 30 feet of him. They must all immediately make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw, becoming paralyzed for 1 minute and taking 55 (10d10) slashing damage on a failed saving throw, or half on a success, as countless bleeding wounds appear across their body. On a success, the creature takes half damage and is not paralyzed. A creature reduced to 0 by this effect makes death saving throws with disadvantage. While paralyzed by this effect, the creature appears to hang by threads, like a morbid marionette, and at the end of each of their turns, they may choose to attempt the saving throw again, ending the effect on a success, or taking 11 (2d10) slashing damage on a failure.Â¢

Rag Plague“The Rag Mage summons \Monster{raggamoffyns} to his aid, which break off from his body and gather any nearby trash into their form. He may summon up to 16 raggamoffyns in total, but \Monster{lesser raggmoffyns} count as one, common \Monster{raggamoffyns} count as two, and \Monster{greater raggamoffyns} count as four. He then takes force damage equal to the effective number of raggamoffyns he summoned.Òï

The \Condition{frightened} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the lich's gaze for the next 24 hours.ð
Disrupt Life (Costs 3 Actions)ÍEach living creature within 20 feet of the lich must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.”

SkullDemilichBƒThe Skulls of Skullport were the first and final word on law and order, and their behavior could be unpredictable and often absurd.:Ô&Prior to the inexplicable change in behaviour that came with the \Group{Xanathars} seizing power, the \Group{Skulls of Skullport} were seen as the first and final word on law and order. \Group{Skulkers} did everything in their power to not incur their wrath, or create a Disturbance. Disturbances were any behaviours that interfered with the status quo of \Place{Skullport}, as defined by the unknowable whims of the Skulls. Only one hard and fast law is known, and it is the Monolithic Decree, named for the monolith in \Place{Shadow Pass}, where it is most often heard.

\em{This be safe haven to all traders and customers. Keep your weapons and your uncivil tongue sheathed lest you find the grinning skull of Death smiling in your face.}

Disturbances that have drawn the Skullsâ€™ ire in the past include:\list{Disrupting or suppressing trade of any goods, including slaves.}{Large-scale conflict between one or more families, factions, or gangs of Skullport.}{Outward religious proselytizing or evangelizing (Though they take no offence to religious symbolism being worn or discussed).}{Use of unstable magic.}{Large-scale vandalism (though what constitutes â€˜vandalismâ€™ is often inconsistent).}{Reneging on major trade agreements.}{Trying to damage the monolith in Shadow Pass.}

However, these can hardly be taken as guidelines, as the Skulls are inscrutable, and what is considered a Disturbance varied wildly, as well as the typical response. The most extreme reaction was to disintegrate the problem person on the spot, or summon \Monster{wizshades} to slay them. However, more often, the Skulls would make some absurd demand of the offending party. Failure to abide by these demands would lead to one of the former, more deadly results. Past demands include:\list{Offer to empty the chamberpots of every single person in the Lower Heart. If they refuse, insist twice more before accepting no for an answer.}{Spend the coming week at one of the local inns. Every time a Calishite enters the inn, you must buy every person in the dining room a pint of \Item{Wyrmwizz}.}{Stand on the Murkspan bridge for 72 hours straight, and only consume what is freely given to you without your asking.}{Ask \NPC{Morganis Andropoea} how her husband is doing (See UH2).}{Treat the first goblin you see as your honoured house guest for the next monthâ€”tend to their every need and request.}

Presently, their behaviour is more in line with a cabal of senile elders. Some of the recent, strange behaviour of the Skulls includes:\list{Floating into a building, telekinetically pulling up a chair in front of a table, and floating above that chair as if it were the head of a body sitting in it. It will not leave until food is placed in front of it, at which point it telekinetically lifts the food, puts it in its mouth, makes an exaggerated chewing motion, and then floats away. The food drops onto the chair, mostly unaffected save for being bitten.}{Humming, whistling, and singing songs in an ancient, forgotten language. One who uses magic to understand the language finds that the song is macabre nonsense related to dismemberment. Sometimes several of them will join together in an accompaniment of whistling, humming, and singing.}{Hovering over \Group{Skulkers} while they sleep. Skulkers who wake are understandably startled, but if they make any sudden noises, it makes a clacking motion with its jaw as if laughing before floating away.}{Picking people up telekinetically, dangling them over the pit to the Dungeons, and then calmly putting them back down next to it.}{Floating at eye-level with travellers, bumping into them, and then constantly moving left and right to prevent them from getting by, all the while repeating 'Sorry' in different languages.}{Skulkers will occasionally get a drink spilled on their head by a Skull high above that has stolen a cup and is trying to drink.}

No one is entirely certain why this is, but theories range from 'Halasterâ€™s doing' to 'the wild magic of \Place{Undermountain} has finally broken them' to 'the \NPC{Xanathar} has a machine that makes them stupid'. Nonetheless, the Skulls of Skullport, as far as anyone can tell, cannot die. So long as \Place{Skullport} remains, the Skulls, too, remain. If one of the Skulls is somehow destroyed, a random humanoid is chosen from the resident population. The replacement Skull emerges, 24 hours later, from the head of the unlucky victim, in a spectacularly gory manner. For this and many other reasons, newcomers are harshly warned against attempting to harm the Skulls.

When possible, the Skulls prefer not to fight directly, and rely on \Monster{wizshades} to enforce their will. When they do fight, they tend to use nonlethal ethods, such as \Spell{forcecage}, \Spell{maze}, \Spell{imprisonment}, \Spell{true polymorph}, and \Spell{feeblemind} to put down Disturbances, but if necessary, they will \Spell{disintegrate} those who cause trouble.JR

Howl (Recharge 5-6)ÏThe skull emits a bloodcurdling howl. Each creature within 30 feet of the skull that can hear the howl must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.

Cloud of DustÕThe demilich magically swirls its dusty remains. Each creature within 10 feet of the demilich, including around a corner, must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of the demilich's next turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this effect until the end of the demilich's next turn.“
Energy Drain (Costs 2 Actions)ðEach creature with in 30 feet of the demilich must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's hit point maximum is magically reduced by 10 (3d6). If a creature's hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect, the creature dies. A creature's hit point maximum can be restored with the \Spell{greater restoration} spell or similar magic.î
Vile Curse (Costs 3 Actions)ÍThe demilich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically cursed.

WizshadeArchmageHumanBûWizshades, summoned servants of the Skulls, are shadowy figures of mages, potentially tortured souls of Netherese arcanists, who are not pushovers and seek to enforce the Skulls' will, but may not seek to kill unless the Disturbance caused was severe.:ìWizshades, the servants of the \Monster{Skulls}, appear when summoned and cannot be made to disobey the orders of the \Monster{Skulls}. They appear as shadowy, translucent figures of what was once a mage, and each is unique. Many theorize that these figures are the tortured souls of \Group{Netherese} arcanists who lost their lives during the fall of \Place{Netheril}. One way or another, these creatures may be servants, but they are no pushovers, and should not be underestimated.

Courtblade
Greatsword:These curved elven greatswords have an unusual weight to them that makes them horrendously unwieldy to one who is not specially trained in their use. A creature who has not received specialized training with the courtblade suffers disadvantage to hit with the weapon. A trained wielder, however, is a truly lethal sight to behold on the battlefield, as they use the bladeâ€™s unusual weight and momentum to their advantage in a carefully-choreographed dance. Courtblades are rarely available for sale, and those claiming to sell a courtblade are often charlatans peddling fake goods. True courtblades are forged by the elves, and typically only given as gifts. A non-elf who wields a courtblade draws both respect and suspicion from elves who understand the importance of the weapon.z rËThese curved elven greatswords have an unusual weight to them that makes them horrendously unwieldy to one who is not specially trained in their use.

Singing Sword	Weapon +1B¦Twelve singing swords, bestowed by Eilistraee, are either greatswords or courtblades. Some are still wielded by the Chosen, while others are lost to various missions.: #Centuries ago, twelve \Monster{drow} lead by \NPC{Qilue Veladorn} were chosen by Eilistraee for a great quest. To aid them in this quest, each was bestowed a singing sword. Each is either a \Item{courtblade} or a \Item{greatsword}, and was named by the first wielder. Four of these swords are carried by members of the Chosen, while the other eight have been lost to the ages in various missions.

Singing swords can only be attuned by one considered worthy by \God{Eilistraee}, a chaotic good \Monster{drow} goddess who embodies freedom, art, love, and beauty. Characters who enslave others or engage in acts of senseless cruelty can never attune to such a weapon unless they atone and grow to be better people â€” such a creature who attempts to attune to the weapon takes 22 (4d10) radiant damage and drops it. \God{Eilistraee} favours those whose actions bring beauty into the world, but does not care for rigid codes or firm rules. She has a special softspot for those of checkered pasts who sincerely seek to self-improve.

A singing sword functions as a +1 weapon (either courtblade or greatsword), and its fine craftsmanship increases its damage die by one step (to a d12 for courtblades, and 2d8 for greatswords). Additionally, as a bonus action, a wielder can initiate its battle song, which lasts for 1 hour, or until the weapon is sheathed, dropped, or deactivated as a bonus action. Allies within 60 feet who can hear the song, including the wielder, cannot be charmed or frightened, and any such effect is suppressed on them so long as they are affected by the song. Additionally, affected creatures add a d4 to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws so long as they can hear the song.

Once this property is used, it cannot be use again until the next dawn. Alternatively, an attuned creature can recharge this effect by taking 10 minutes to play a song for the sword, and making a DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check. On a success, the sword instantly recharges this ability.

 On a failure, this cannot be attempted again until the following dawn. Each additional time this is done in a day, the DC for the check increases by 5.

 The twelve singing swords, and their various statuses, are as follows:\list{\bold{Feradas:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \NPC{Qilue}, who dove into the \Place{Pit of Ghaunadaur} and did battle with its monstrosities to win the \Group{Keepers of the Song} enough time to seal it off. Her body, and the sword, were never recovered. Some believe this sword to have had unique properties, but others believe that it was just \NPC{Qilue}â€™s exceptional nature.}{\bold{Juris:} Courtblade; currently wielded by \NPC{Iljrene.}}{\bold{Aella:} Greatsword; currently wielded by \NPC{Elkantar.}}{\bold{Milthanyr:} Courtblade; currently wielded by \NPC{Duthra}.}{\bold{Kadas:} Courtblade; currently wielded by \NPC{Furia}.}{\bold{Valyorta:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \NPC{Domna}, who was deployed on a mission to find the \Place{Lost Level}. Never returned.}{\bold{Nylgoth:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \NPC{Ryzz}, who was deployed on a mission to find the \Item{Throne of Syglaeth Audark}. Never returned.}{\bold{Tritz:} Greatsword; previously wielded by \NPC{Vykus}, who was deployed in an attack on a cult of \God{Ghaunadaur on the Twisted Caverns}. The mission was a success, but at great cost â€” \NPC{Vykus} was swallowed by a beast of \God{Ghaunadaur}, and her body, as well as her sword, were never recovered.}{\bold{Azurith:} Greatsword; previously wielded by \NPC{Vandin}, who was caught in an ambush by drow on the \Place{Crystal Labyrinth} while investigating signs of \God{Juiblex}â€™s influence there. Only one member of the unit, \NPC{Fimdell}, made it back, and he did so without his superiorâ€™s sword.}{\bold{Momath:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \NPC{Oren}, who was betrayed and pushed through a gate into the tenth floor of \Place{Undermountain}, where the \Monster{drow} of \Group{House Auvryndar} made quick work of her.}{\bold{Vitanna:} Greatsword; previously wielded by \NPC{Trun}, who is thought to have been killed while on a scouting mission in \Place{Waterdeep}. The sword is in the possession of a noble, but no one knows which.}{\bold{Sornafein:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \NPC{Selddar}, who tried to establish a secondary base of operations in \Place{Slitherswamp}. The base was partially-built when, all of a sudden, messages from it stopped. No one is certain what become of Sornafein or its wielder.}JSTR#
