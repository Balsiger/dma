When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Dexterity saving throw.

The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

After you use your breath weapon, you can‚Äôt use it again until you com plete a short or long rest.í

Dragonborn2$
Player's Handbook	WTC A9217 !:GenericBõBorn of \Monster{dragons}, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the \Monster{dragons} themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.\title{Proud Dragon Kin} Dragonborn look very much like \Monster{dragons} standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6 1/2 feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.

The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through som e dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor‚Äîbright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.\title{Self-Sufficient Clans} To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn‚Äôs conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.

A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the  self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push them selves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect o f a dragonborn.

Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races ‚Äî or even from the gods.JçProud Dragonborn are born from \Monster{dragons} and strive to be self-sufficient. They value skill and excellence and put their clans first.rdragonborn.png

Player's Handbook	WTC A9217:GenericBóBold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.

Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most com m on shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, w orn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair.
