    description: "Referred to in this adventure simply as 'Manshoon', this clone of the ancient archwizard infiltrated \\Place{Waterdeep} years ago and has been hiding out in \\Place{Kolat Towers} ever since, in the city's \\Place{Southern Ward}.\n\nThe original \\NPC{Manshoon} was one of the founders of the \\Group{Zhentarim}. Evil to the core, he made enemies all across  \\Place{Faert√ªn}, including other powerful spellcasters such as \\NPC{Khelben Arunsun} and \\NPC{Elminster}. Fearing that he might be destroyed by his foes, \\NPC{Manshoon} magically crafted several clones - but a mishap caused all of them to be awakened at once, whereupon they tried to destroy one another in a series of conflicts that came to be known as the \\Event{Manshoon Wars}.\n\nNow the original \\NPC{Manshoon} is dead, and it's widely believed that all his clones were destroyed as well. In fact, at least three are still alive. The one presently in \\Place{Waterdeep} escaped death by hiding out in \\Place{Undermountain}, where he eventually ran afoul of \\NPC{Halaster Blackcloak}. After a brief spell duel, \\NPC{Halaster} captured \\NPC{Manshoon} and amputated his left arm at the elbow for reasons unknown. \\NPC{Manshoon} escaped imprisonment and fled \\Place{Undermountain}, taking refuge in the city above. Attempts to magically regenerate his severed limb failed, forcing him to craft an artificial arm and hand for himself.\n\n\\NPC{Manshoon} took control of \\Place{Kolat Towers}, a crumbling residence in the \\Place{Southern Ward} that was abandoned years ago by the two wizards who built it. The edifice is surrounded by a magical barrier that has the properties of a wall of force. \\NPC{Manshoon} rarely leaves the towers and uses a teleportation circle when he must do so, and thus is never seen entering or leaving. \\NPC{Manshoon} aims to rule \\Place{Waterdeep} and replace the \\Group{City Watch} with \\Group{Black Network} mercenaries that are loyal to him alone. By bribing and blackmailing the \\Group{Masked Lords}, he hopes to oust \\NPC{Laeral Silverhand} as \\NPC{Open Lord} and take her place, kill the \\NPC{Blackstaff}, reduce the \\Group{Masked Lords} to mere vassals, and declare himself the Wizard-King of \\Place{Waterdeep}. Once the city is firmly in his clutches, Manshoon will then turn his attention toward \\Place{Undermountain}, destroy \\NPC{Halaster} once and for all, and claim the dungeon's riches."
