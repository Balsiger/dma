If possessing a host they appear as humans in dim light and are often mistaken for \\Monster{adherers} or \\Monster{mummies} in brighter light.\\title{Combat} All raggamoffyns attempt to envelop potential victims in order to control them. If successful, the parts of the raggamoffyn cling to the victim in a skin-tight sheath from head to toe. The raggamoffyn usually creat a hood to cover the victim\'s face as well. Once enveloped, a victim is forced to do the raggamoffyn\'s bidding until the creature is done with them or they are able to resist the creature\'s control.\\title{Society}These creatures can not speak but they understand the Common tongue. All raggamoffyns are driven to create more of their kind, but a host is required to do so. The host is enveloped and forced to destroy magic items while the raggamoffyn performs a silent rite that mysteriously creates a new raggamoffyn. The host is usually not directly harmed during this process, though the raggamoffyn often forces them to commit crimes in order to attain magic items, the result of which could lead to the hosts getting harmed.\n\nAside from \\Monster{gutterspites}, the other forms of raggamoffyn can not possess \\Monster{gnomes} or \\Monster{duergar}.\\title{History} The exact origin of these creatures remains unclear. Some believe them to be remnants of magic items that were discarded. Others believe the \\NPC{Rag Mage} was creating them using a cursed \\Item{Manual of golems}."

    description: "Prior to the inexplicable change in behaviour that came with the \\Group{Xanathars} seizing power, the \\Group{Skulls of Skullport} were seen as the first and final word on law and order. \\Group{Skulkers} did everything in their power to not incur their wrath, or create a Disturbance. Disturbances were any behaviours that interfered with the status quo of \\Place{Skullport}, as defined by the unknowable whims of the Skulls. Only one hard and fast law is known, and it is the Monolithic Decree, named for the monolith in \\Place{Shadow Pass}, where it is most often heard.\n\n\\em{This be safe haven to all traders and customers. Keep your weapons and your uncivil tongue sheathed lest you find the grinning skull of Death smiling in your face.}\n\nDisturbances that have drawn the Skulls\342\200\231 ire in the past include:\\list{Disrupting or suppressing trade of any goods, including slaves.}{Large-scale conflict between one or more families, factions, or gangs of Skullport.}{Outward religious proselytizing or evangelizing (Though they take no offence to religious symbolism being worn or discussed).}{Use of unstable magic.}{Large-scale vandalism (though what constitutes \342\200\230vandalism\342\200\231 is often inconsistent).}{Reneging on major trade agreements.}{Trying to damage the monolith in Shadow Pass.}\n\nHowever, these can hardly be taken as guidelines, as the Skulls are inscrutable, and what is considered a Disturbance varied wildly, as well as the typical response. The most extreme reaction was to disintegrate the problem person on the spot, or summon \\Monster{wizshades} to slay them. However, more often, the Skulls would make some absurd demand of the offending party. Failure to abide by these demands would lead to one of the former, more deadly results. Past demands include:\\list{Offer to empty the chamberpots of every single person in the Lower Heart. If they refuse, insist twice more before accepting no for an answer.}{Spend the coming week at one of the local inns. Every time a Calishite enters the inn, you must buy every person in the dining room a pint of \\Item{Wyrmwizz}.}{Stand on the Murkspan bridge for 72 hours straight, and only consume what is freely given to you without your asking.}{Ask \\NPC{Morganis Andropoea} how her husband is doing (See UH2).}{Treat the first goblin you see as your honoured house guest for the next month\342\200\224tend to their every need and request.}\n\nPresently, their behaviour is more in line with a cabal of senile elders. Some of the recent, strange behaviour of the Skulls includes:\\list{Floating into a building, telekinetically pulling up a chair in front of a table, and floating above that chair as if it were the head of a body sitting in it. It will not leave until food is placed in front of it, at which point it telekinetically lifts the food, puts it in its mouth, makes an exaggerated chewing motion, and then floats away. The food drops onto the chair, mostly unaffected save for being bitten.}{Humming, whistling, and singing songs in an ancient, forgotten language. One who uses magic to understand the language finds that the song is macabre nonsense related to dismemberment. Sometimes several of them will join together in an accompaniment of whistling, humming, and singing.}{Hovering over \\Group{Skulkers} while they sleep. Skulkers who wake are understandably startled, but if they make any sudden noises, it makes a clacking motion with its jaw as if laughing before floating away.}{Picking people up telekinetically, dangling them over the pit to the Dungeons, and then calmly putting them back down next to it.}{Floating at eye-level with travellers, bumping into them, and then constantly moving left and right to prevent them from getting by, all the while repeating \'Sorry\' in different languages.}{Skulkers will occasionally get a drink spilled on their head by a Skull high above that has stolen a cup and is trying to drink.}\n\nNo one is entirely certain why this is, but theories range from \'Halaster\342\200\231s doing\' to \'the wild magic of \\Place{Undermountain} has finally broken them\' to \'the \\NPC{Xanathar} has a machine that makes them stupid\'. Nonetheless, the Skulls of Skullport, as far as anyone can tell, cannot die. So long as \\Place{Skullport} remains, the Skulls, too, remain. If one of the Skulls is somehow destroyed, a random humanoid is chosen from the resident population. The replacement Skull emerges, 24 hours later, from the head of the unlucky victim, in a spectacularly gory manner. For this and many other reasons, newcomers are harshly warned against attempting to harm the Skulls.\n\nWhen possible, the Skulls prefer not to fight directly, and rely on \\Monster{wizshades} to enforce their will. When they do fight, they tend to use nonlethal ethods, such as \\Spell{forcecage}, \\Spell{maze}, \\Spell{imprisonment}, \\Spell{true polymorph}, and \\Spell{feeblemind} to put down Disturbances, but if necessary, they will \\Spell{disintegrate} those who cause trouble."

    description: "Centuries ago, twelve \\Monster{drow} lead by \\NPC{Qilue Veladorn} were chosen by Eilistraee for a great quest. To aid them in this quest, each was bestowed a singing sword. Each is either a \\Item{courtblade} or a \\Item{greatsword}, and was named by the first wielder. Four of these swords are carried by members of the Chosen, while the other eight have been lost to the ages in various missions.\n\nSinging swords can only be attuned by one considered worthy by \\God{Eilistraee}, a chaotic good \\Monster{drow} goddess who embodies freedom, art, love, and beauty. Characters who enslave others or engage in acts of senseless cruelty can never attune to such a weapon unless they atone and grow to be better people \342\200\224 such a creature who attempts to attune to the weapon takes 22 (4d10) radiant damage and drops it. \\God{Eilistraee} favours those whose actions bring beauty into the world, but does not care for rigid codes or firm rules. She has a special softspot for those of checkered pasts who sincerely seek to self-improve.\n\nA singing sword functions as a +1 weapon (either courtblade or greatsword), and its fine craftsmanship increases its damage die by one step (to a d12 for courtblades, and 2d8 for greatswords). Additionally, as a bonus action, a wielder can initiate its battle song, which lasts for 1 hour, or until the weapon is sheathed, dropped, or deactivated as a bonus action. Allies within 60 feet who can hear the song, including the wielder, cannot be charmed or frightened, and any such effect is suppressed on them so long as they are affected by the song. Additionally, affected creatures add a d4 to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws so long as they can hear the song.\n\nOnce this property is used, it cannot be use again until the next dawn. Alternatively, an attuned creature can recharge this effect by taking 10 minutes to play a song for the sword, and making a DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check. On a success, the sword instantly recharges this ability.\n\n On a failure, this cannot be attempted again until the following dawn. Each additional time this is done in a day, the DC for the check increases by 5.\n\n The twelve singing swords, and their various statuses, are as follows:\\list{\\bold{Feradas:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \\NPC{Qilue}, who dove into the \\Place{Pit of Ghaunadaur} and did battle with its monstrosities to win the \\Group{Keepers of the Song} enough time to seal it off. Her body, and the sword, were never recovered. Some believe this sword to have had unique properties, but others believe that it was just \\NPC{Qilue}\342\200\231s exceptional nature.}{\\bold{Juris:} Courtblade; currently wielded by \\NPC{Iljrene.}}{\\bold{Aella:} Greatsword; currently wielded by \\NPC{Elkantar.}}{\\bold{Milthanyr:} Courtblade; currently wielded by \\NPC{Duthra}.}{\\bold{Kadas:} Courtblade; currently wielded by \\NPC{Furia}.}{\\bold{Valyorta:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \\NPC{Domna}, who was deployed on a mission to find the \\Place{Lost Level}. Never returned.}{\\bold{Nylgoth:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \\NPC{Ryzz}, who was deployed on a mission to find the \\Item{Throne of Syglaeth Audark}. Never returned.}{\\bold{Tritz:} Greatsword; previously wielded by \\NPC{Vykus}, who was deployed in an attack on a cult of \\God{Ghaunadaur on the Twisted Caverns}. The mission was a success, but at great cost \342\200\224 \\NPC{Vykus} was swallowed by a beast of \\God{Ghaunadaur}, and her body, as well as her sword, were never recovered.}{\\bold{Azurith:} Greatsword; previously wielded by \\NPC{Vandin}, who was caught in an ambush by drow on the \\Place{Crystal Labyrinth} while investigating signs of \\God{Juiblex}\342\200\231s influence there. Only one member of the unit, \\NPC{Fimdell}, made it back, and he did so without his superior\342\200\231s sword.}{\\bold{Momath:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \\NPC{Oren}, who was betrayed and pushed through a gate into the tenth floor of \\Place{Undermountain}, where the \\Monster{drow} of \\Group{House Auvryndar} made quick work of her.}{\\bold{Vitanna:} Greatsword; previously wielded by \\NPC{Trun}, who is thought to have been killed while on a scouting mission in \\Place{Waterdeep}. The sword is in the possession of a noble, but no one knows which.}{\\bold{Sornafein:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \\NPC{Selddar}, who tried to establish a secondary base of operations in \\Place{Slitherswamp}. The base was partially-built when, all of a sudden, messages from it stopped. No one is certain what become of Sornafein or its wielder.}"
