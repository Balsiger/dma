INTRODUCTION
WELCOME TO ADVENTU
THIS STORY BEGAN 50 YEARS AGO, AND YOU ' RE PART O F
it. In the 1970s. Gary Gyga x and Dave Arneson created a
game of make -believe that fused rules with storytelling.
There"d n ever been anything like it: a game in which each
player made their own fantasy character and teamed up
with their friends to go on quests. One person served as the
narrator and referee-the Dungeon Master-and did every thing
they could to challenge and delight the other players.
That game was, of course, the first version of Dungeons &
Dragons. andyou're now reading its latest version.
Over the decades, millions of people have played D&D,
and scores of writers. game designers. and artists have
made their mark on it through its various editions. When
our team released the current edition in 2014 , we were
humbled by how many of you loved it. This revised version
of it is a salute to all of you-those of you who've been
playing D&D for years, those of you who've contributed to
the game through your feedback, and those of you who are
about to experience the joy of playing itfor the first time.
As a teenager, I met both Gary and Dave. I even spent
an entire day with Gary, and we did what all D&D fans do:
share stories about our adventures in the D&:D multiverse.
I invite you to embark on such adventures anew. Share as
much laughter as you can withyourfriends. Use onry the
rules that serve your fun, and always follow your group's
bliss. So many people have been enjoying the magic of D&:D
for half a century. Let's keep it blazing for another 50 years!
-Jeremy Crawford
RE YOU READY TO EMBARK ON FANTASY
adventures with your friends? DUNGEONS
& DRAGONS invites you to play imaginary
adventurers who delve into dungeons and other
perilous locations together, face fearsome foes such
as dragons, and build friendships forged amid fantastical
dangers.
Fueled by imagination and rules, D&D invites
you to adopt a fantasy persona-a mighty Fighter, a
cunning Rogue, a faithful Cleric, a magical Wizard,
or something else-and then solve problems, fight
monsters, and visit wondrous places.
There's no winning and losing in D&D, at least
not the way those terms are usually understood.
Together you and friends create an exciting story
of adventurers who confront perils. Sometimes an
INTRODUCTION I WELCOME TO ADVENTURE
adventurer might come to a tragic end . Eve n so, the
other adventurers can search for powerful magi c to
revive their fallen comrade, or the characte r's player
might create a new character t o carry on. No m a tter
what happens , if everyone has a good time a nd creates
a memor able story, they all win.
WHAT You NEED
Here's what you need to play D&D with one or more
friends (a typical group has five people):
Dungeon Master. One person takes on the role of
the Dungeon Master (DM), the game's lead storyteller
and referee. The DM creates adventures for
the players' characters, who navigate its hazards
and decide which paths to explore. The DM also
narrates what they experience and plays the
friends and foes they meet along the way. Even
though the DM challenges the adventurers, the
DM always strives to delight the whole group.
Players. Each player creates an adventurer who
teams up with the other players' adventurers.
Working together, the group might explore a dark
dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost
temple, a lava-filled mountain, or another location
described by the DM. The adventurers also solve
puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic
monsters, and discover magic items and other
treasure-all while supporting each other's fun.
You also need these resources, either in physical
form or on DnDBeyond.com:
Player's Handbook. This book is your essential
reference for the game's rules, and it guides you
through making an adventurer of your own.
Dungeon Master's Guide and Monster Manual. The
first of these books guides the OM through creating
and running adventures, and the second holds
hundreds of monsters to fill those adventures.
LEARN BY WATCHING
A great way to learn the basics of D&D is to watch
people play it. The Internet offers videos of D&D
play that show off the tremendous range of possibilities
the game offers. As you watch, pay attention
to the ways that some players help make the
game fun for everyone in their group. The only
audience you need to entertain when you're playing
D&D is yourself and your group.
Dice. Yo u n ee d a set of polyhedral dice (shown in
cha pter 1). You can find dice like these in game
sto1·es a nd from online retailers. Dice-rolling apps
are also ava ilable .
Character Sheet. To keep track of important information
about your character, you need a character
sheet, which can be as simple as a piece of
paper you write notes on or as feature -rich as a
digital record.
The DM might also find these accessories useful:
DM Screen. Many DMs like to use a screen to
shield their notes and dice rolls from players. It's
bad manners to peek over the screen!
Miniatures and Battle Grid. Some DMs use a battle
grid and miniatures to run combat encounters,
since they help everyone visualize the action. A
battle grid can be anything marked out in 1-inch
squares, from disposable sheets of paper to poster
maps . And miniatures range from simple tokens
to detailed figurines. Online maps and miniatures
are also available, including on DnDBeyond.com.
USING THIS BOOK
Here's what you'll find in this book:
Chapter 1: Playing the Game. The first chapter explains
the fundamentals of the game, with examples
to help you understand how to play.
Chapter 2: Creating a Character. Chapter 2 walks
you through the steps of character creation.
Chapter 3: Character Classes. Characters' capabilities
are largely determined by class, such as
Fighter or Wizard. Chapter 3 offers twelve classes
to choose from, along with forty-eight subclasses.
Chapter 4: Character Origins. Background and
species are key elements in defining a character's
origin, which further shapes the character's abilities
beyond the choice of class. Background and
species options are presented in chapter 4.
Chapter 5: Feats. The feats in chapter 5 are special
features that characters gain as part of their background
and class.
Chapter 6: Equipment. Armor, weapons, and adventuring
gear are found in chapter 6 .
Chapter 7: Spells. This chapter contains descriptions
of the spells that spellcasters can cast.
Appendix A: The Multiverse. Here you'll find an
overview of the magical multiverse where D&D
adventures take place.
Appendix B: Creature Stat Blocks. This appendix
brims with game information for creatures that
certain characters can befriend or transform into.
Appendix C: Rules Glossary. The game's main
rules terminology is summarized in this appendix,
making it an invaluable reference during play.
WHAT'S NEW IN THE 2024 VERSION?
This is the 2024 version of the fifth edition Player's
Handbook. If you've read the 2014 version,
much of this book will feel familiar, since the fundamental
rules of the game are the same. But the
book contains many new or redesigned elements,
and the versions of things in this book replace
versions from older books. Here are highlights:
Streamlined Rules. The game's rules have been
streamlined and are now supported by a rules
glossary.
Easier Character Creation. Using chapter 2, making
a character is easier than ever before.
Enhanced Classes. In chapter 3, every class and
subclass has been enhanced with new options.
Reimagined Origins. Explored in chapter 4, a
character's origin is now defined by background
and species, each of which has been
redesigned.
Expanded Feats. In chapter 5, feats have been redesigned,
with many feats added.
Upgraded Weapons, Tools, and Crafting. Mastery
properties transform how weapon wielders use
their weapons, and every character can enjoy
new tool and crafting rules in chapter 6.
Dazzling Spells. Chapter 7 bursts with new spells
and old ones that have been enhanced.
If you can't find a rule, check the index. If a rule's
name has changed from what was printed in the
2014 Player's Handbook, the index points you to
the new name. For example, if you look up Inspiration
in the index, it points you to the rules for
Heroic Inspiration in the rules glossary.
WORLDS OF ADVENTURE
The worlds of D&D glimmer with magic, monsters,
and spectacular adventure. Launching from a foundation
of medieval fantasy, these worlds soar with
possibilities beyond those of our reality.
D&D worlds exist in a multiverse and are connected
to one another and to other planes of existence.
Some of the worlds have been published
as official D&D settings, including the Greyhawk,
Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Spelljammer,
Planescape, Dark Sun, Eberron, and Ravenloft settings.
Alongside these worlds are thousands more,
created by generations of D&D players for their own
games. Amid the richness of the multiverse, you
might create a world of your own.
The worlds of the multiverse share characteristics,
but each world is set apart by its own history
and geography. Your OM might set a campaign on
one of these worlds or on a world of their own invention.
Because there is so much variety among
D&D worlds, check with your DM about the world
of your upcoming adventures.
INTRODUCTION I WELCOME TO ADVENTURE 5

CHAPTER 1
PI.,AYING THE GAME
•. _.., MAGI NATION IS A KEY INGREDIENT OF
]. J; DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, a cooperative game
L.__ in which the characters that you roleplay embark
on adventures together in fantasy worlds filled
with monsters and magic.
In D&D, the action takes place in the imaginations
of the players, and it's narrated by everyone together.
Here's a glimpse at what that looks like:
Jared (as Dungeon Master): After your long journey,
Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling
towers of stone-perhaps abandoned guardhouses-
loom over the approach . Beyond them ,
you see a gaping chasm disappearing into deep
fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm,
its chains creaking in the wind . Stone gargoyles
stare down at you from the high walls, and a pale
light spills into the courtyard from the open castle
doors beyond.
Phillip (as Gareth): I examine the gargoyles. I have a
feeling they're not just statues!
Maeve (as Mirabella): I want to see how sturdy the
drawbridge is. Do I think we can cross it, or is it
going to collapse under our weight?
Jared: All right, one at a time. Phillip, Gareth's looking
at the gargoyles?
Phillip: Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures
and not just decorations?
Jared: Make an Intelligence check.
Phillip: Does my Investigation skill apply?
Jared: Sure!
Phillip (rolling a d20): Ugh. Seven.
Jared: They look like decorations to you. And Maeve,
Mirabella is examining the drawbridge?
The adventure continues from there, relying on
the DM's descriptions to set the scenes. Later in the
chapter, other examples of play focus on certain
aspects of D&D play: social interaction, exploration,
and combat.
RULES GLOSSARY
If you read a rules term in this book and want to
know its definition, consult the rules glossary,
which is appendix C. This chapter provides an
overview of how to play D&D and focuses on the
big picture. Many places in this chapter reference
that glossary.
PLAYER OR DM?
To play D&D, you need one person to be the Dungeon
Master and other players (three to six are best)
to play adventurers. Which role is right for you?
BEING A PLAYER
If you want to be one of the protagonists in your
group's adventures, consider being a player. Here's
what players do:
Make a Character. Your character is your alter ego
in the fantasy world of the game. After you read
this chapter, use the rules in chapter 2 to create
your character.
Team Up. Your character joins the other players'
characters to form an adventuring party. These
adventurers are allies who face challenges and
fantastical situations together. Each character
brings distinctive capabilities, which ideally complement
those of the other characters.
Venture Forth. Your character's group explores
locations and events presented by the DM. You
can respond to them in any way you can imagine,
guided by the rules in this book. Although the
DM controls all the monsters you encounter, the
DM isn't your adversary. The DM guides your
party's journey as your characters become more
powerful.
BEING THE DUNGEON MASTER
If you want to be the mastermind of the game, consider
being the DM. Here's what DMs do:
Build Adventures. You prepare the adventures that
the players experience. In the Dungeon Master's
Guide, you'll find advice for how to create adventures
and even whole worlds.
Guide the Story. You narrate much of the action
during play, describing locations and creatures
that the adventurers face. The players decide what
their characters do as they navigate hazards and
choose what to explore. Then you use a combination
of imagination and the game's rules to determine
the results of the adventurers' decisions.
Adjudicate the Rules. You oversee how the group
uses the game's rules, making sure the rules serve
the group's fun. You'll want to read the rest of this
chapter to understand those rules, and you'll find
the rules glossary essential.
C HAPTER I I PLA'I ING THE GAM E 7
RHYTHM OF PLAY
The three main pillars of D&D play are social in teraction.
exploration, and combat. Whichever one
you're experiencing, the game unfolds according to
this basic pattern:
1: The Dungeon Master Describes a Scene. The
OM tells the players where their adventurers are
and what's around them (how many doors lead
out of a room, what's on a table, and so on}.
2: The Players Describe What Their Characters
Do. Typically, the characters stick together as
they travel through a dungeon or another environment.
Sometimes different adventurers do
different things: one adventurer might search a
treasure chest while a second examines a mysterious
symbol engraved on a wall and a third
keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the
DM ensures that every character has a chance to
act and decides how to resolve their activity. In
combat, the characters take turns.
3: The DM Narrates the Results of the Adventurers'
Actions. Sometimes resolving a task is easy.
If an adventurer walks across a room and tries
to open a door, the DM might say the door opens
and describe what lies beyond. But the door
might be locked, the floor might hide a trap, or
some other circumstance might make it challenging
for an adventurer to complete a task. In those
cases, the DM might ask the player to roll a die to
help determine what happens. Describing the results
often leads to another decision point, which
brings the game back to step 1.
This pattern holds during every game session (each
time you sit down to play D&D), whether the adventurers
are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin, or
fighting a dragon. In certain situations-particularly
combat-the action is more structured, and everyone
takes turns.
EXCEPTIONS SUPERSEDE GENERAL RULES
General rules govern each part of the game. For
example, the combat rules tell you that melee
attacks use Strength and ranged attacks use
Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general
rule is in effect as long as something in the game
doesn't explicitly say otherwise.
The game also includes elements-class features,
feats, weapon properties, spells, magic
items, monster abilities, and the like-that sometimes
contradict a general rule. When an exception
and a general rule disagree, the exception
wins. For example, if a feature says you can make
melee attacks using your Charisma, you can do
so, even though that statement disagrees with
the general rule.
CHAPTER I I PLAYING THE GAME
AN ONGOING GAME
Sometimes a session of D&D is a complete ga me in
itself (often called a "one-shot"}, where you play a
short adventure that lasts for just one session . More
often, though, D&D sessions are connected in a
longer adventure that takes several sessions to complete,
and adventures can be strung together into a
larger narrative called a campaign.
A campaign is like a TV series, while an adventure
is like a season of the series . And a game session is
like a single episode- it might be self-contained, but
it usually links to the larger plot if there is one.
ADVENTURES
An adventure might be created by the Dungeon
Master or purchased (the examples of play in this
chapter are inspired by a published adventure, Curse
of Strahd) . In either case, an adventure features a
fantastic setting, such as an underground dungeon,
a wondrous wilderness, or a magic-filled city. It includes
a cast of non player characters controlled by
the DM . Often one of the NPCs is a villain whose
agenda drives much of an adventure's action.
During an adventure, the adventurers explore
environments, events, and creatures presented by
the DM. Battles, traps, negotiations, mysteries, and
more arise during these explorations.
Adventures vary in length and complexity. A
short adventure might present only a few challenges
and take only one session to complete. A long adventure
might involve many combats, interactions,
and other challenges and take dozens of sessions.
CAMPAIGNS
A campaign is a series of adventures with a consistent
group of adventurers following the narrative.
Some campaigns are episodic, where each adventure
is its own tale and not much besides the player
characters links it to the next one. Other campaigns
involve long-running plots, a cast of recurring
NPCs, and themes that span multiple adventures,
leading toward a climactic conclusion.
As with adventures, a DM might create a campaign
from scratch, assemble a campaign from
published adventures, or mix homemade material
with published material. And the campaign might
take place in a world of the DM's creation or in a
published campaign setting, such as the Forgotten
Realms or Greyhawk (the latter is described in the
Dungeon Master's Guide).
ROUND DOWN
Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the
game, round down if you end up with a fraction,
even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some
rules make an exception and tell you to round up.
DICE
Dice acid randomness to the game. They help determine
whether characters and monsters are successful
at the things they attempt.
DICE NOTATION
The dice used in D&D are referred to by the letter
d followed by the die's number of sides: d4, d6, dB,
dlO, d12, and d2O. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided
die (the cube that many games use). The illustration
on this page shows what each die looks like.
When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how
many dice to roll of a certain type, along with any
numbers to add or subtract. For example, "3d8 + S"
means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together,
and add 5 to the total.
PERCENTILE DICE
The rules sometimes refer to a dlOO. While such
dice exist, the common way to roll ldlOO uses a pair
of ten-sided dice numbered from O to 9, known as
percentile dice. One die-that you designate before
rolling-gives the tens digit, and the other gives the
ones digit. If you roll a 7 for the tens digit and a 1 for
the ones digit, for example, the number rolled is 71.
Two Os represent 100.
Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10,
20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the
tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of
70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and O is 100.
D3
The same d notation appears in the expression
"ld3," even though it's rare to find dice with only
three sides. To simulate rolling ld3, roll ld6 and divide
the number rolled by 2 (round up).
WHAT ARE DICE FOR?
Here are the most common uses of dice in D&D.
D20 TEST
The 2O-sided die (d2O) is the most important die
you'll use in the game. It's central to the core mechanic-
called D2O Tests-the game uses to determine
whether creatures succeed or fail at the things
06
INTERPRETING DIE Rous IN THE STORY
Part of the fun of D&D is interpreting what die
rolls mean in the story. The randomness that dice
bring often introduces the unexpected: an expert
fails, a novice succeeds, or any number of other
twists. When a D20 Test or another roll produces
a surprise, the Dungeon Master often gives a fun
description of what happened. If you're a player,
look for opportunities to interpret your character's
die rolls and describe why things unfolded
unexpectedly or even humorously.
they attempt during the game (see "D2O Tests"
later in this chapter). You roll a d2O whenever your
character tries to do something that the DM decides
has a chance of both success and failure. The higher
your roll, the more likely it is that you succeed.
DAMAGE
The most common use for dice other than the d2O
is to determine damage. When you make a successful
attack roll (one kind of D2O Test), you roll
damage to see how effective the attack is. When you
cast a spell, you might also roll damage. Different
weapons and spells use different dice for damage.
For example, a Dagger uses ld4, a Greataxe uses
ld12, and a Fireball spell uses 8d6.
RANDOM TABLES
Occasionally, you'll see a table that uses a die roll to
generate a random result. On these tables, you'll see
a die expression, such as dlO or dlOO, in the header
of the leftmost column. Roll that die, and find the
number you rolled (or a range containing that number)
in that column. Read across that row for the
result. For example, the Trinkets table in chapter 2
uses a dlOO.
PERCENTAGE CHANCES
Sometimes you might see a rule describing a percentage
chance of something happening. For example,
a rule might say there is a 5 percent chance of
something happening. You can determine whether
that thing happens by rolling percentile dice; if the
roll is equal to or less than the percentage chance (a
01 to 05, in this example), it happens.

IO CHAPTER 1 I PLAYING THE GAME
D20 TESTS
When the outcome of an action is uncertain, t h e
game uses a d20 roll to determine success or failure.
These rolls are called D20 Tests, and they come in
three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and attack
rolls. They follow these steps:
1: Roll 1d20. You always want to roll high. If the
roll has Advantage or Disadvantage (described
later in this chapter), you roll two d20s, but
you use the number from only one of them- the
higher one if you have Advantage or the lower
one if you have Disadvantage.
2: Add Modifiers. Add these modifiers to the number
rolled on the d20:
The Relevant Ability Modifier. This chapter and
the rules glossary explain which ability modifiers
to use for various D20 Tests.
Your Proficiency Bonus If Relevant. Each creature
has a Proficiency Bonus, a number added
when making a D20 Test that uses something,
such as a skill, in which the creature has proficiency.
See "Proficiency" later in this chapter.
Circumstantial Bonuses and Penalties. A class
feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus
or penalty to the die roll.
3: Compare the Total to a Target Number. If the
total of the d20 and its modifiers equals or exceeds
the target number, the D20 Test succeeds.
Otherwise, it fails. The Dungeon Master determines
target numbers and tells players whether
their rolls are successful. The target number
for an ability check or a saving throw is called a
Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an
attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC), which
appears on a character sheet or in a stat block
(see the rules glossary).
ABILITY CHECKS
An ability check represents a creature using talent
and training to try to overcome a challenge, such
as forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertaining
a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The OM
and the rules often call for an ability check when a
creature attempts something other than an attack
that has a chance of meaningful failure. When the
outcome is uncertain and narratively interesting,
the dice determine the result.
ABILITY MODIFIER
An ability check is named for the ability modifier it
uses: a Strength check, an Intelligence check, and so
on. Different ability checks are called for in different
situations, depending on which ability is most
relevant. See the Ability Check Examples table for
examples of each check's use.
ABILITY CHECK EXAMPLES
Ability Make a Check To ...
Strength
Dexterity
Constitution
Intelligence
Wisdom
Charisma
Lift, push, pull, or break something
Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly
Push your body beyond normal limits
Reason or remember
Notice things in the environment or
in creatures' behavior
Influence, entertain, or deceive
PROFICIENCY BONUS
Add your Proficiency Bonus to an ability check
when the DM determines that a skill or tool proficiency
is relevant to the check and you have
that proficiency. For example, if a rule refers to a
Strength (Acrobatics or Athletics) check, you can
add your Proficiency Bonus to the check if you have
proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. See
"Proficiency" later in this chapter for more information
about skill and tool proficiencies.
DIFFICULTY CLASS
The Difficulty Class of an ability check represents
the task's difficulty. The more difficult the task, the
higher its DC. The rules provide DCs for certain
checks, but the OM ultimately sets them. The Typical
Difficulty Classes table presents a range of possible
DCs for ability checks.

A saving throw-also called a save-represents an
attempt to evade or resist a threat, such as a fiery
explosion, a blast of poisonous gas, or a spell trying
to invade your mind. You don't normally choose to
make a save; you must make one because your character
or a monster (if you're the OM) is at risk. A
save's result is detailed in the effect that caused it.
If you don't want to resist the effect, you can
choose to fail the save without rolling.
ABILITY MODIFIER
Saving throws are named for the ability modifiers
they use: a Constitution saving throw, a Wisdom
saving throw, and so on. Different saving throws
are used to resist different kinds of effects, as shown
on the Saving Throw Examples table.
CHAPTER l I PLAY ING THE GAME II
SAVING THROW EXAMPLES
Ability Make a Save To ...
Strength Physically resist direct force
Dexterity Dodge out of harm's way
Constitution Endure a toxic hazard
Intelligence Recognize an illusion as fake
Wisdom Resist a mental assault
Charisma Assert your identity
PROFICIENCY BONUS
You add your Proficiency Bonus to your saving
throw if you have proficiency in that kind of save.
See "Proficiency" later in this chapter.
DIFFICULTY CLASS
The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined
by the effect that causes it or by the DM. For
example, if a spell forces you to make a save, the DC
is determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and
Proficiency Bonus. Monster abilities that call for
saves specify the DC.
ATTACK ROLLS
An attack roll determines whether an attack hits
a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or exceeds
the target's Armor Class. Attack rolls usually
occur in battle, described in "Combat" later in this
chapter, but the DM might also ask for an attack roll
in other situations, such as an archery competition.
ABILITY MODIFIER
The Attack Roll Abilities table shows which ability
modifier to use for different types of attack rolls.
ATTACK ROLL ABILITIES
Ability Attack Type
Strength Melee attack with a weapon or an Unarmed
Strike (see the rules glossary)
Dexterity Ranged attack with a weapon
Varies Spell attack (the ability used is determined
by the spellcaster's spellcasting
feature, as explained in chapter 7)
Some features let you use different ability modifiers
from those listed. For example, the Finesse property
(see chapter 6) lets you use Strength or Dexterity
with a weapon that has that property.
PROFICIENCY BONUS
You add your Proficiency Bonus to your attack roll
when you attack using a weapon you have proficiency
with, as well as when you attack with a spell.
See "Proficiency" later in this chapter for more information
about weapon proficiencies.
12 CHAPTER 1 I PLAYI NG TH E GAME
ARMOR CLASS
A creature's Armor Class represents how well the
creature avoids being wounded in comba t. The AC
of a character is determined at character creation
(see chapter 2), whereas the AC of a monster appears
in its stat block.
Calculating AC. All creatures start with the same
base AC calculation :
Base AC= 10 + the creature's Dexterity modifier
A creature's AC can then be modified by armor,
magic items, spells, and more.
Only One Base AC. Some spells and class features
give characters a different way to calculate their
AC. A character with multiple features that give different
ways to calculate AC must choose which one
to use; only one base calculation can be in effect for
a creature.
ROLLING 20 OR 1
If you roll a 20 on the d20 (called a "natural 20")
for an attack roll, the attack hits regardless of any
modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a Critical
Hit (see "Combat" later in this chapter) .
If you roll a 1 on the d20 (a "natural 1") for an attack
roll, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers
or the target's AC.
ADVANTAGE/DISADVANTAGE
Sometimes a D20 Test is modified by Advantage
or Disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive
circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while Disadvantage
reflects negative circumstances.
You usually acquire Advantage or Disadvantage
through the use of special abilities and actions. The
DM can also decide that circumstances grant Advantage
or impose Disadvantage.
ROLL Two D20s
When a roll has either Advantage or Disadvantage,
roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the
higher of the two rolls if you have Advantage, and
use the lower roll if you have Disadvantage. For example,
if you have Disadvantage and roll an 18 and a
3, use the 3. If you instead have Advantage and roll
those numbers, use the 18.
THEY DON'T STACK
If multiple situations affect a roll and they all grant
Advantage on it, you still roll only two d20s. Similarly,
if multiple situations impose Disadvantage on
a roll, you roll only two d20s.
If circumstances cause a roll to have both Advantage
and Disadvantage, the roll has neither of them,
and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple
circumstances impose Disadvantage and only one
grants Advantage or vice versa. In such a situation,
you have neither Advantage nor Disadvantage.
IF y ou H /\vE Aov/\ NT/\GE, u s e THE 18.
IF YO U H/\VE 01 S/\ OVANT/\GE , u s e THE 3.
INTERACTIONS WITH REROLLS
When you have Advantage or Disadvantage and
something in the game lets you reroll or replace
the d20, you can reroll or replace only one die, not
both. You choose which one.
For example, if you have Heroic Inspiration (see
the sidebar) and roll a 3 and an 18 on an ability
check that has Advantage or Disadvantage, you
could expend your Heroic Inspiration to reroll one
of those dice, not both of them.
HEROIC INSPIRATION
Sometimes the DM or a rule gives you Heroic
Inspiration. If you have Heroic Inspiration, you
can expend it to reroll any die immediately after
rolling it, and you must use the new roll.
Only One at a Time. You can never have more
than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If some•
thing gives you Heroic Inspiration and you already
have it, you can give it to a player character
in your group who lacks it.
Gaining Heroic Inspiration. Your DM can give
you Heroic Inspiration for a variety of reasons.
Typically, DMs award it when you do something
particularly heroic, in character, or entertaining.
It's a reward for making the game more fun for
everyone playing.
Other rules might allow your character to gain
Heroic Inspiration independent of the DM's decision.
For example, Human characters start each
day with Heroic Inspiration.
PROFICIENCY
Characters and monsters are good at various things.
Some are skilled with many weapons, while others
can use only a few. Some are better at understanding
people's motives, and others are better at unlocking
the secrets of the multiverse. All creatures
have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the impact
that training has on the creature's capabilities. A
character's Proficiency Bonus increases as the character
gains levels (described in chapter 2). Amonster's
Proficiency Bonus is based on its Challenge
Rating (see the rules glossary). The Proficiency Bonus
table shows how the bonus is determined.
This bonus is applied to a D20 Test when the creature
has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or
with an item that the creature uses to make the D20
Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for
calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.
PROFICIENCY BONUS
Level or CR Bonus Level or CR Bonus
Up to 4 +2 17-20 +6
5-8 +3 21-24 +7
9-12 +4 25-28 +8
13-16 +5 29-30 +9
THE BONUS DOESN'T STACK
Your Proficiency Bonus can't be added to a die roll
or another number more than once. For example, if
a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or
Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus
if you're proficient in either skill, but you don't add
it twice if you're proficient in both skills.
Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied
or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before
being added. For example, the Expertise feature
(see the rules glossary) doubles the Proficiency Bonus
for certain ability checks. Whenever the bonus
is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided
only once.
SKILL PROFICIENCIES
Most ability checks involve using a skill, which represents
a category of things creatures try to do with
an ability check. The descriptions of the actions
you take (see "Actions" later in this chapter) specify
which skill applies if you make an ability check for
that action, and many other rules note when a skill
is relevant. The OM has the ultimate say on whether
a skill is relevant in a situation.
If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature
applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks involving
that skill. Without proficiency in a skill,
a creature can still make ability checks involving

example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the DM
might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the
character has Athletics proficiency, the character
adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check.
If the character lacks that proficiency, they make
the check without adding their Proficiency Bonus.
SKILL LIST
The skills are shown on the Skills table, which notes
example uses for each skill proficiency as well as the
ability check the skill most often applies to.
DETERMINING SKILLS
A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined
at character creation, and a monster's skill
proficiencies appear in its stat block.
SKILLS WITH DIFFERENT ABILITIES
Each skill proficiency is associated with an ability
check. For example, the Intimidation skill is
associated with Charisma. In some situations,
the DM might allow you to apply your skill proficiency
to a different ability check. For example, if
a character tries to intimidate someone through a
show of physical strength, the DM might ask for
a Strength (Intimidation) check rather than a Charisma
(Intimidation) check . That character would
make a Strength check and add their Proficiency
Bonus if they have Intimidation proficiency.
14, CH APTER 1 I PL AYI NG T HE G A ME
SAVING THROW PROFICIENCIES
Proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add
their Proficiency Bonus to saves that use a particular
ability. For example, proficiency in Wisdom
saves lets you add your Proficiency Bonus to your
Wisdom saves. Some monsters also have saving
throw proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks.
Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving
throws, representing that class's training in evading
or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for example,
are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves;
they train to resist mental assault.
EQUIPMENT PROFICIENCIES
A character gains proficiency with various weapons
and tools from their class and background. There
are two categories of equipment proficiency:
Weapons. Anyone can wield a weapon, but proficiency
makes you better at wielding it. If you have
proficiency with a weapon, you add your Proficiency
Bonus to attack rolls you make with it.
Tools. If you have proficiency with a tool, you can
add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check
you make that uses the tool. If you have Proficiency
in the skill that's also used with that check,
you have Advantage on the check too. This means
you can benefit from both skill proficiency and
tool proficiency on the same a bility check.

a trigger you define.
Search Make a Wisdom (Insight, Medicine ,
Perception, or Survival) check.

Investigation, Nature, or Religion) check.
Utilize Use a nonmagical object.
Player characters and monsters can also do things
not covered by these actions. Many class features
and other abilities provide additional action options,
and you can improvise other actions. When you describe
an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules,
the Dungeon Master tells you whether that action
is possible and what kind of D20 Test you need to
make, if any.
ONE THING AT A TIME
The game uses actions to govern how much you can
do at one time. You can take only one action at a
time . This principle is most important in combat, as
explained in "Combat" later in this chapter.
Actions can come up in other situations, too: in a
social interaction , you can try to Influence a creature
or use the Search action to read the creature's
body language, but you can't do both at the same
time. And when you're exploring a dungeon, you
can't simultaneously use the Search action to look
for traps and use the Help action to aid another
character who's trying to open a stuck door (with
the Utilize action).
BONUS ACTIONS
Various class features, spells, and other abilities let
you take an additional action on your turn called a
Bonus Action. The Cunning Action feature, for example,
allows a Rogue to take a Bonus Action. You
can take a Bonus Action only when a special ability,
a spell, or another feature of the game states that
you can do something as a Bonus Action. You otherwise
don't have a Bonus Action to take.
You can take only one Bonus Action on your turn,
so you must choose which Bonus Action to use if
you have more than one available .
You choose when to take a Bonus Action during
your turn unless the Bonus Action's timing is specif1ed
. Anything that deprives you of your ability to
take actions also prevents you from taking a Bonus
Action.
REACTIONS
Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow
you to take a special action called a Reaction. A
Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some
kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone
else's. The Opportunity Attack, described later in
this chapter, is the most common type of Reaction.
When you take a Reaction , you can't take another
one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction
interrupts another creature's turn, that creature
can continue its turn right after the Reaction.
In terms of timing, a Reaction takes place immediately
after its trigger unless the Reaction's description
says otherwise.
WHAT WOULD YOUR CHARACTER Do?
Ask yourself as you play, "What would my character
do?" Playing a role involves some amount
of getting into another person's head and understanding
what motivates them and how those
motivations translate into action. In D&D , those
actions unfold against the backdrop of a fantastic
world full of situations we can only imagine. How
does your character react to those situations?
This advice comes with one important caveat:
avoid character choices that ruin the fun of the
other players and the OM. Choose actions that
delight you and your friends.
CHAPTER 1 I P L AY I N G T HE GAME 15
SOCIAL INTERACTION
During their adventures, player characters meet
many different people and face some monsters that
would rather talk than fight. In those situations, it's
time for social interaction, which takes many forms .
For example, you might try to convince a burglar
to confess to wrongdoing or try to flatter a guard .
The Dungeon Master assumes the roles of any nonplayer
characters who are participating.
An NPC's attitude toward your character is
Friendly, Indifferent, or Hostile, as defined in the
rules glossary. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to
help, and Hostile ones are inclined to hinder.
Social interactions progress in two ways: through
roleplaying and ability checks.
ROLEPLAYING
Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role.
In this case, it's you as a player determining how
your character thinks, acts, and talks. Roleplaying is
part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the
fore during social interactions.
As you roleplay, consider whether you prefer an
active approach or a descriptive approach, each of
which is described in "Social Interaction Example."
The DM uses an NPC's personality and your character's
actions and attitudes to determine how an
NPC reacts. A cowardly bandit might buckle under
16 CHAPTER 1 I PLAYING THE GAME
threats of imprisonment. A stubborn merchant
refuses to help if the characters badger her. A vain
dragon laps up flattery.
When interacting with an N PC , pay attention to
the DM's portrayal of the NPC's personality. You
might be able to learn an NPC's goals and then use
that information to influence the NPC.
If you offer NPCs something they want or play
on their sympathies, fears, or goals, you can form
friendships , ward off violence, or learn a key piece
of information. On the other hand, if you insult a
proud warrior or speak ill of a noble's allies, your
efforts to convince or deceive will likely fail.
ABILITY CHECKS
Ability checks can be key in determining the outcome
of a social interaction. Your roleplaying efforts
can alter an NPC's attitude, but there might
still be an element of chance if the DM wants dice to
play a role in determining an NPC's response to you.
In such situations, the DM will typically ask you to
take the Influence action.
Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when
thinking of how you will interact with an NPC; use
an approach that relies on your group's skill proficiencies.
For example, if the group needs to trick a
guard into letting them into a castle, the Rogue who
is proficient in Deception should lead the discussion.
SOCIAL I NTERACTION EXAMPLE
In this scene, players engage in a social interaction
encounter. You and your group determine how
similar scenes play out in your adventures.
Four adventurers-Shreeve, Mirabella, Auro, and
Gareth-have traveled to the Blood on the Vine tavern
in the grim village of Barovia.
Jared (as OM): This tavern might have been finely
appointed once, but it has grown shoddy with the
passage of years. A blazing fire in the hearth barely
gives any warmth to the room. You see a man
behind the counter, methodically cleaning glasses.
Three older women huddle together at one table.
And a handsome young man sits by himself at
a corner table, sipping a glass of wine. He looks
up as you enter, but the other people ignore you.
"Welcome to Barovia," he says. He holds a coin
toward the bartender: "A pitcher for the visitors."
The glint of silver catches the server's attention.
Maeve (as Mirabella): "Thank you , friend. May we
know to whom we're indebted?"
Jared: "I am lsmark Kolyanovich, though around
here, I am often called lsmark the Lesser."
Russell (as Shreeve): "That's unfortunate."
Jared: "Indeed. I hope one day to live up to my father's
example and rid myself of that title. And so,
my new friends, who are you?"
Amy (as Auro): "I'm Auro."
Russell: "Shreeve."
Phillip (as Gareth): "My name is Gareth."
Maeve (as Mirabella): "I'm called Mirabella. You said
your name was Kolyanovich. Are you related to
Kolyan lndirovich, the burgomaster of this town?"
Jared: He looks a little surprised. He says, "Kolyan
lndirovich is my esteemed father, yes."
Maeve: "Then he's the one who summoned us!" I
show him the letter that drew us here.
Phillip: I watch his reaction as he reads it. I Jared: He reaches for the letter but pulls back before
T touching it. "That seal-it's not my father's ."
Gareth, make a Wisdom (Insight) check.
Phillip: Gareth got 18.
Jared: You notice that lsmark is trying to conceal his
terror. He's afraid to even touch the letter's seal.
Phillip: I ask him what's frightening him.
Russell: "Yeah, whose seal is it?"
Jared: "The Devil Strahd."
Amy: "Sounds like a pleasant fellow."
Jared: "No! He is the vampire lord of Castle Ravenloft
and a plague to my sister. You must help her!"
Active Roleplaying. Notice throughout the
example how Russell and Amy actively roleplay
their characters' behavior. In this active
approach, they speak with their characters'
voices, like an actor taking on a role. The
players might even echo their characters'
body language. They still need to describe
things that can 't reasonably be acted out.
Descriptive Roleplaying. Notice how Phillip
describes his character's words and action.
Drawing on his mental image of his character,
he says what his character does and
how the character does it. If this approach is
most comfortable for you, keep these things
in mind:
• Describe your character's emotions and
attitude.
• Focus on your character's intent and how
others might perceive it.
• Provide as much embellishment as you
feel comfortable with.
Don't worry about getting things exactly
right. Focus on what your character would
do, and describe what you see in your mind.
o~;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;::;;;===~
Ability Checks. Phillip's character, Gareth,
makes a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine
whether he reads lsmark's unspoken
cues. Wisdom is the ability that measures
perceptiveness and intuition. Insight reflects
a character's skill at reading other people's
moods and intentions. The OM set the DC
at 15, which Gareth beats. With a successful
Wisdom (Insight) check, Gareth gleans information
that wasn't obvious, so it wasn't
part of the DM 's earlier narration. For more
information, see "Ability Scores" and "Proficiency"
earlier in this chapter and the Search
action in the rules glossary.
Amy: "So Strahd wrote this letter, pretending to be
the burgomaster, imploring us to come to Barovia
and rescue lreena Kolyana from a deadly affliction
... which is him? Why would he do that?"
Russell: "Why would he want us to come here?"
Maeve: "Clearly, he doesn't think we're a threat."
Amy: "Well, he hasn't met us yet!"
Jared: "He's toying with you. He delights in the destruction
of all things good, like my dear sister."
Phillip: Gareth draws closer and compassionately
asks lsmark whether his sister has been bitten by
the vampire.
Jared: Please make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to
see how well he responds to your pastoral manner.
You have Advantage because he's Friendly.
Phillip: Oh, good thing. My first roll was a 7, but with
Advantage ... ugh, not much better. Well, 10 plus
5 is 15.
Jared: lsmark leans toward you, Gareth, with a suspicious
glance at the other people in the tavern, like
he's worried they're eavesdropping. He whispers,
"The Devil Strahd desires to make lreena his latest
plaything. Twice he has visited her in the night,
using his devilry to secure an invitation into the
house-for he can't enter where he isn't invited.
Twice he has bitten her, yet she clings to life. But I
fear she won't survive another visit!"
Russell: "All right, lsmark. You bought us drinks
and told us about the Devil Strahd and your sister.
How can we help?"
dl r.HAPT11111 I PLAYING THE GAME
Jared: "You are too kind! First, I need your help
transporting lreena to the town ofVallaki."
Maeve: "Where's Vallaki?"
Jared: "It lies to the northwest, in the heart of the
valley. As the raven Aies, it is less than ten miles,
but the road winds among the hills and woods,
and the journey takes at least five hours at speed."
Russell: "And why there?"
Jared: "The town lies beyond the view of Castle
Ravenloft, so I hope it's beyond Strahd's spies.
And I have heard that Vallaki is well defended, with
a wooden palisade and iron gates."
Russell: "As if such defenses would stop a vampire."
Jared: "Indeed. But if moving her there can keep him
away from her for even a few days, we have time
for the second part of our task."
Russell: "A part where you help us?"
Jared: "Yes, when I help you face the vampire!"

Influencing NPCs. Gareth takes the Influence
action (see the rules glossary), which characters
can take to influence an NPC. It's easier
to influence an N PC who's already disposed
to help you, as lsmark is here. lsmark's
Friendly attitude gives Phillip Advantage on
the roll. In this case, Advantage made the
difference between success and failure. 0
EX PLO Rl'::..TION
Exploration involves delving into places that are
dangerous a nd full of mystery. The rules in this
section det ai l s ome of the ways adventurers interact
with the environment in such places.
ADVENTURING EQUIPMENT "--- ---------
As adventurers explore, their equipment can help
them in many ways. For example , they can reach
out-of-the -way places with a Ladder, perceive things
they wouldn't otherwise notice with a Torch or
another light source, bypass locked doors and containers
with Thieves' Tools, and create obstacles for
pursuers with Ca ltrops.
See chapter 6 for rules on many items that are
useful on adventures. The items in that chapter's
"Tools" and "Adventuring Gear" sections are especially
useful. The weapons in that chapter can
also be used for more than battle; you could use a
Quartersta ff , for example, to push a sinister-looking
button that you' re reluctant to touch.
VISION AND LIGHT
Some adventuring tasks-such as noticing danger,
hitting an enemy, and targeting certain spells-are
affected by sight, so effects that obscure vision can
hinder you, as explained below.
OBSCUR E D AREAS
An area might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured. In
a Lightly Obscured area-such as an area with Dim
Light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage-you have
Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that
rely on sight.
A Heavily Obscured area-such as an area with
Darkness, heavy fog, or dense foliage-is opaque.
You have the Blinded condition (see the rules glossary)
when trying to see something there.
LIGHT
The presence or absence of light determines the category
of illumination in an area, as defined below.
Bright Light. Bright Light lets most creatures see
normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light,
as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of
illumination within a specific radius.
Dim Light. Dim Light, also called shadows, creates
a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light is
usually a boundary between Bright Light and surrounding
Darkness. The soft light of twilight and
dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might
bathe the land in Dim Light.
Darkness. Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured
area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night
{even most moonlit nights), within the confines of
an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.
SPECIAL SENSES
Some creatures have special senses that help them
perceive things in certain situations. The rules glossary
defines the following special senses:
Blindsight
Darkvision
HIDING
Tremorsense
Truesight
Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to
spy on one another, sneak past a guardian, or set
an ambush. The Dungeon Master decides when circumstances
are appropriate for hiding. When you
try to hide, you take the Hide action.
INTERACTING WITH OBJECTS
Interacting with objects is often simple to resolve.
The player tells the OM that their character is doing
something, such as moving a lever or opening a
door, and the OM describes what happens. Sometimes,
however, rules govern what you can do with
an object, as detailed in the following sections.
,... .. . ._ n .m •"" - • & -- • ----- - - - - - - ~
WHAT Is AN OBJECT?
For the purpose of the rules, an object is a discrete,
inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book,
table, chair, or stone. It isn't a building or a vehicle,
which are composed of many objects.
nME-LIMITED OBJECT INTERACTIONS
When time is short, such as in combat, interactions
with objects are limited: one free interaction per
turn. That interaction must occur during a creature's
movement or action. Any additional interactions
require the Utilize action, as explained in
"Combat" later in this chapter.
FINDING HIDDEN OBJECTS
When your character searches for hidden things,
such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically
asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check,
provided you describe the character searching in
the hidden object's vicinity. On a success, you find
the object, other important details, or both.
If you describe your character searching nowhere
near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check
won't reveal the object, no matter the check's total.
CARRYING OBJECTS
You can usually carry your gear and treasure without
worrying about the weight of those objects.
If you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a
massive number of lighter objects, the DM might require
you to abide by the rules for carrying capacity
in the rules glossary.
BREAKING OBJECTS
As an action, you can automatically break or otherwise
destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such as
a glass container or a piece of paper. If you try to
damage something more resilient, the DM might use
the rules on breaking objects in the rules glossary.
HAZARDS
Monsters are the main perils characters face, but
other dangers await. The rules glossary defines the
following hazards:
Burning
Dehydration
TRAVEL
Falling
Malnutrition
Suffocation
During an adventure, the characters might travel
long distances on trips that could take hours or
days. The DM can summarize this travel without
calculating exact distances or travel times, or the
DM might have you use the travel pace rules below.
If you need to know how fast you can move when
every second matters, see the movement rules in
"Combat" later in this chapter.
20 CHAPTER l I PLAYING THE GAME
MARCHING ORDER
The adventurers should establish a marching
order while they travel , whether indoors or outdoors.
A marching order makes it easier to determine
which characters are affected by traps ,
which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which
ones are the closest to those enemies if a fight
breaks out. You can change your marching order
outside combat and record the order any way you
like: write it down, for example , or arrange miniatures
to show it .
TRAVEL PACE
While traveling outside combat, a group can move
at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the
Travel Pace table. The table states how far the
party can move in a period of time; if riding horses
or other mounts, the group can move twice that
distance for 1 hour, after which the mounts need
a Short or Long Rest before they can move at that
increased pace again (see chapter 6 for a selection
of mounts for sale). The Dungeon Master 's Guide has
rules that affect which pace you can choose in certain
types of terrain .
TRAVEL PACE
Distance Traveled Per ...
Pace Minute Hour Day
Fast 400 feet 4 miles 30 miles
Normal 300 feet 3 miles 24 miles
Slow 200 feet 2 miles 18 miles
Each travel pace has a game effect, as defined below.
Fast. Traveling at a Fast pace imposes Disadvantage
on a traveler's Wisdom (Perception or Survival)
and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Normal. Traveling at a Normal pace imposes Disadvantage
on Dexterity (Stealth} checks.
Slow. Traveling at a Slow pace grants Advantage
on Wisdom (Perception or Survival} checks.
VEHICLES
Travelers in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles
choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne
vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel,
and they don't choose a travel pace. Depending on
the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be
able to travel for up to 24 hours per day. Chapter 6
includes vehicles for sale.
EXPLORATION EXAMPLE
This scene finds the player characters investigating
a mysterious and potentially dangerous location.
They're moving through the environment and interacting
with things they find there.
§

r
Q,
The charact ers are exploring Castle Raven/oft, and the
OM describes the room the characters have entered.
Jared (as OM): A blazing hearth fire fills this room
with warm light. Firelight glints off a poker beside
the fireplace, and the wal ls are lined with ancient
books. A huge painting hangs above the mantelpiece
in a gilded frame. The firelight illuminates
the portrait-an exact likeness of lreena Kolyana.
Phillip (as Gareth): How old does the painting look?
Maeve (as Mirabella): I'm going to check the books!
Jared: OK, I'll get to those in a second. Russell and
Amy, what are your characters doing?
Russell (as Shreeve): I stand near the door, sword
drawn, ready for danger. This place is creepy!
Amy (as Auro): I go near the fireplace. A warm fire
sounds nice. But I'm also alert for danger.
I Jared: Got it. OK, Phillip, please make an lntel~igence
(History) check as Gareth looks at the painting.
' Phillip: I don't have proficiency in History, but here I goes. I got-oh! A 20! For a total of ... 20.
Jared: Two things leap out at Gareth about the painting.
First, the woman's clothes look old-fashioned.
Second, the paint is flaking in places, and the
whole thing is covered by a thin layer of soot.
You'd say this painting is a few centuries old.
Phillip: So maybe an ancestor of lreena's? Unless
she's already a vampire and this "bitten by Strahd"
thing is a ruse.
Jared: Who knows? Now, Mirabella's looking at the
books?
Maeve: Yeah, I pull one off the shelf at random.
Everyone Is Accounted For. Exploration is
open-ended; the players don't take turns
moving around the dungeon the way they do
in combat. But the OM frequently checks in
to make sure it 's clear where everyone is and
what they're doing.
Teamwork Matters. The player characters
are working toward a common goal. They
move together through the dungeon and
cooperate to overcome its challenges. When
the characters enter the room, they explore
different parts of the room. When Auro finds
a secret door behind the fireplace later in the
example, they come together again to examine
it, and Gareth figures out how to bypass
the fire. It might seem like Russell's character
wasn't doing much, but Shreeve was protecting
the group by guarding the door.
Oo-i=========~
Worth Rolling with or without Proficiency.
You usually have a chance of success on
an ability check even if you don't have proficiency
in a relevant skill. In the example,
Phill ip gets a 20 without proficiency. The d20
brings many surprises to the game-surprises
that the DM then interprets.
CH APTER l I PLAY ING THE GAME
Jared: It's a book written in Common called On the
Habitations of the Divine in the Celestial and Infernal
Realms.
Russell: Did you just make that up?
Jared: I'll never tell. As you flip through the book , you
notice it's very academic, almost impenetrable .
Maeve: OK, I put that one back and pull out another.
Jared: Are Shreeve and Auro doing anything else?
j Amy: I grab the poker and poke at logs in the fire. O Jared: As soon as you lift the poker, you hear a grind-
I ing sound, and the back of the fireplace slides to
the side, revealing a room behind it!
Amy: " Uh , folks? I found something !" Can I see
anything in the room beyond?
Jared: Past the flames and smoke, you see a glimmering
pile of co ins heaped near a chest . lAmy: Anybody have a quick way to put out a fire?
Phillip: And you laughed at me for preparing Create
or Destroy Water! I clutch my Holy Symbol and
cast the spell, drenching the fireplace .
Jared: What does the spell's descr iption say?
Phillip: It causes l 0 gallons of water to ra in down in
a 30-foot Cube, ext i nguishing flames there.
Jared: Great! That puts out the fire. Without the light
from the hearth, you 're back to the magic glow
of Shreeve's sword, which casts your shadows
into the room beyond. But you can see , through
clouds of lingering smoke, a closed chest on the
floor, surrounded by piles of coins. There are two
torch sconces on the far wall - one holding an
unlit torch with an intricate metal base, the other
empty. A skeleton in broken plate armor is lying
against that wall , with one hand at its t hroat and
the other holding the matching torch from the
empty sconce.
Amy: I check out the chest!
Jared: And the rest of you?
Phillip: Gareth enters and looks at the skeleton .
Maeve: I keep watch on this side of the fireplace .
Russell: I'm still back by the first door.
Jared: Amy, the chest seems expertly made, with
elegant fittings and clawed feet.
Amy: I try to open i t. Is it locked?
Jared: It's not locked and opens easi ly-and it re leases
a cloud of sweet-smelling gas .
Amy: Oh, no.
Jared: Oh, yes . I need Auro and Gareth to make Constitution
saving throws.
Amy: Sorry, Phillip! I got an 8.
Phillip: And a 5 for Gareth.
Jared: As you draw this gas into your lungs, you feel
a ch ill gr ip you, and your bodies stiffen. You both
have the Paralyzed condition!

COMBAT
Adventurers encounter many dangerous monsters
and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat
often breaks out.
THE ORDER OF COMBAT
A typical combat encounter is a clash between two
sides: a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries,
footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes
combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round
represents about 6 seconds in the game world.
During a round, each participant in a battle takes a
turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning
of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once
everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to
the next round if neither side is defeated.
COMBAT STEP BY STEP
Combat unfolds in these steps:
1: Establish Positions. The Dungeon Master determines
where all the characters and monsters are
located. Given the adventurers' marching order
or their stated positions in the room or other location,
the DM figures out where the adversaries
are-how far away and in what direction.
2: Roll Initiative. Everyone involved in the combat
encounter rolls Initiative, determining the order
of combatants' turns.
3: Take Turns. Each participant in the battle takes
a turn in Initiative order. When everyone involved
in the combat has had a turn, the round
ends. Repeat this step until the fighting stops.
INITIATIVE
Initiative determines the order of turns during
combat. When combat starts, every participant
rolls Initiative; they make a Dexterity check that
determines their place in the Initiative order. The
OM rolls for monsters. For a group of identical creatures,
the OM makes a single roll, so each member
of the group has the same Initiative.
Surprise. If a combatant is surprised by combat
starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their
Initiative roll. For example, if an ambusher starts
combat while hidden from a foe who is unaware
that combat is starting, that foe is surprised.
Initiative Order. A combatant's check total is
called their Initiative count, or Initiative for short.
The OM ranks the combatants, from highest to
lowest Initiative. This is the order in which they act
during each round. The Initiative order remains the
same from round to round.
Ties. If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order
among tied monsters, and the players decide the
order among tied characters. The DM decides the
order if the tie is between a monster and a player
character.
YOUR TuRN
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your
Speed and take one action. You decide whether to
move first or take your action first.
The main actions you can take are listed in "Actions"
earlier in this chapter. A character's features
and a monster's stat block also provide action options.
"Movement and Position" later in this chapter
gives the rules for movement.
C H APTE R l I P L AY I NG T H E GA M E 23
Communicating. You can communicate however
you are able-through brief utterances and ges tures-
as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither
your action nor your move.
Extended communication, such as a detailed explanation
of something or an attempt to persuade a
foe, requires an action. The Influence action is the
main way you try to influence a monster.
Interacting with Things. You can interact with
one object or feature of the environment for free,
during either your move or action. For example, you
could open a door during your move as you stride
toward a foe .
If you want to interact with a second object, you
need to take the Utilize action. Some magic items
and other special objects always require an action
to use , as stated in their descriptions.
The DM might require you to use an action for
any of these activities when it needs special care or
when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance,
the DM might require you to take the Utilize action
to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a
drawbridge.
Doing Nothing on Your Tum. You can forgo moving,
taking an action, or doing anything at all on
your turn. If you can't decide what to do, consider
taking the defensive Dodge action or the Ready action
to delay acting.
CHAlffER I I PLAYING THE GAME
ENDING COMBAT
Combat ends when one side or the other is defeated ,
which can mean the creatures are killed or knocked
out or have surrendered or fled. Combat can also
end when both sides agree to end it.
MOVEMENT AND POSITION
On your turn, you can move a distance equal to
your Speed or less. Or you can decide not to move.
Your movement can include climbing, crawling,
jumping, and swimming (each explained in the rules
glossary). These different modes of movement can
be combined with your regular movement, or they
can constitute your entire move.
However you're moving with your Speed, you
deduct the distance of each part of your move from
it until it is used up or until you are done moving,
whichever comes first.
A character's Speed is determined during character
creation . A monster's Speed is noted in the
monster's stat block. See the rules glossary for more
about Speed as well as about special speeds, such as
a Climb Speed, Fly Speed, or Swim Speed.
DIFFICULT TERRAIN
Combatants are often slowed down by Difficult
Terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep
stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of Difficult
Terrain.
PLAYING ON A GRID
If you play usi ng a square grid and miniatures or
other tokens, follow these ru les.
Squares. Each square represents 5 feet.
Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move
square by square on the grid , using your Speed
in 5-foot segments. You can translate your Speed
into squares by dividing it by 5. For example, a
Speed of 30 feet translates into 6 squares. If you
use a grid often , consider writing your Speed in
squares on your character sheet.
Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must
have enough movement left to pay for entering.
It costs l square of movement to enter an unoccupied
square that's adjacent to your space
(orthogonally or diagonally adjacent). A square of
Difficult Terrain costs 2 squares to enter. Other
effects might make a square cost even more.
Corners. Diagonal movement can't cross the
corner of a wall , a large tree, or another terrain
feature that fills its space.
Ranges. To determine the range on a grid
between two things-whether creatures or objects-
count squares from a square adjacent to
one of them and stop counting in the space of the
other one. Count by the shortest route.
Every foot of movement in Difficult Terrain costs
I extra foot, even if multiple things in a space count
as Difficult Terrain.
BREAKING UP YOUR MOVE
You can break up your move, using some of its
movement before and after any action, Bonus Action,
or Reaction you take on the same turn. For example,
if you have a Speed of 30 feet, you could go
10 feet, take an action, and then go 20 feet.
DROPPING PRONE
On your turn, you can give yourself the Prone
condition (see the rules glossary) without using an
action or any of your Speed, but you can't do so if
your Speed is 0.
CREATURE SIZE
A creature belongs to a size category, which determines
the width of the square space the creature
occupies on a map, as shown on the Creature Size
and Space table. That table lists the sizes from
smallest (Tiny) to largest (Gargantuan). A creature's
space is the area that it effectively controls in combat
and the area it needs to fight effectively.
A character's size is determined by species, and
a monster's size is specified in the monster's stat
block.
CREATURE SIZE AND SPACE
Size Space (Feet) Space (Squares)
Tiny 2½ by 2½ feet 4 per square
Small 5 by 5 feet l square
Medium 5 by 5 feet l square
Large 10 by 10 feet 4 squares (2 by 2)
Huge 15 by 15 feet 9 squares (3 by 3)
Gargantuan 20 by 20 feet 16 squares (4 by 4)
MOVING AROUND OTHER CREATURES
During your move, you can pass through the space
of an ally, a creature that has the Incapacitated condition
(see the rules glossary), a Tiny creature, or a
creature that is two sizes larger or smaller than you.
Another creature's space is Difficult Terrain for
you unless that creature is Tiny or your ally.
You can't willingly end a move in a space occupied
by another creature. If you somehow end a turn in
a space with another creature, you have the Prone
condition (see the rules glossary) unless you are
Tiny or are of a larger size than the other creature.
MAKING AN ATTACK
When you take the Attack action, you make an
attack. Some other actions, Bonus Actions, and Reactions
also let you make an attack. Whether you
strike with a Melee weapon, fire a Ranged weapon,
or make an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack
has the following structure:
1: Choose a Target. Pick a target within your attack's
range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2: Determine Modifiers. The DM determines
whether the target has Cover (see the next section)
and whether you have Advantage or Disadvantage
against the target. In addition, spells,
special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties
or bonuses to your attack roll.
3: Resolve the Attack. Make the attack roll, as
detailed earlier in this chapter. On a hit, you roll
damage unless the particular attack has rules
that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special
effects in addition to or instead of damage.
COVER
Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can
provide cover, making a target more difficult to
harm. As detailed in the Cover table, there are three
degrees of cover, each of which gives a different
benefit to a target.
A target can benefit from cover only when an attack
or other effect originates on the opposite side
of the cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of
UNSEEN ATTACKERS AND TARGETS
When you make an attack roll against a target you
can't see, you have Disadvantage on the roll. This
is true whether you're guessing the target's location
or targeting a creature you can hear but not
see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted,
you miss.
When a creature can't see you, you have Advantage
on attack rolls against it .
If you are hidden when you make an attack roll,
you give away your location when the attack hits
or misses.
cover, only the most protective degree of cover ap plies;
the degrees aren't added together. For example,
if a target is behind a creature that gives Half
Cover and a tree trunk that gives Three-Quarters
Cover, the target has Three-Quarters Cover.
COVER
Degree Benefit to Target Offered By ...
Half +2 bonus to AC Another creature or an
and Dexterity object that covers at
saving throws least half of the target
Three- +5 bonus to AC An object that covers
Quarters and Dexterity at least three-quarters
saving throws of the target
Total Can't be targeted An object that covers
directly the whole target
RANGED ATTACKS
When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow,
hurl an axe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a
foe at a distance. Many spells also involve making a
ranged attack.
RANGE
You can make ranged attacks only against targets
within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as
one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't
attack a target beyond this range.
Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a
Longbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is
the normal range, and the larger number is the long
range. Your attack roll has Disadvantage when your
target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack
a target beyond long range.
RANGED ATTACKS IN CLOSE COMBAT
Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe
is next to you. When you make a ranged attack roll
with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you
have Disadvantage on the roll if you are within S
feet of an enemy who can see you and doesn't have
the Incapacitated condition (see the rules glossary).
26 CHAPTER 1 I PLAYING THE GAME
MELEE ATTACKS
A melee attack allows you to attack a target within
your reach. A melee attack typically uses a h and held
weapon or an Unarmed Str ike. Many monsters
make melee attacks with claws, teeth, or oth er b o d y
parts. A few spells also involve melee attacks.
REACH
A creature has a 5-foot reach and can thus attack
targets within 5 feet when making a melee attack .
Certain creatures have melee attacks with a reach
greater than 5 feet, as noted in their d es criptions.
OPPORTUNITY ATTACKS
Combatants watch for enemies to drop their guard.
If you move heedlessly past your foes , you put your self
in danger by provoking an Opportunity Attack.
Avoiding Opportunity Attacks. You can avoid provoking
an Opportunity Attack by taking the Disengage
action. You also don't provoke an Opportunity
Attack when you Teleport or when you are moved
without using your movement , action, Bonus Action,
or Reaction. For example, you don't provoke an
Opportunity Attack if an explosion hurls you out of
a foe's reach or if you fall past an enemy.
Making an Opportunity Attack You can make an
Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can
see leaves your reach. To make the attack, take a
Reaction to make one melee attack with a weapon
or an Unarmed Strike against that creature. The
attack occurs right before it leaves your reach.
MOUNTED COMBAT
A willing creature that is at least one size larger
than a rider and that has an appropriate anatomy
can serve as a mount, using the following rules.
MOUNTING AND DISMOUNTING
During your move, you can mount a creature that
is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs
an amount of movement equal to half your Speed
(round down). For example, if your Speed is 30 feet,
you spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse.
CONTROLLING A MOUNT
You can control a mount only if it has been trained
to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, mules, and
similar creatures have such training.
The Initiative of a controlled mount changes to
match yours when you mount it. It moves on your
turn as you direct it, and it has only three action options
during that turn: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge.
A controlled mount can move and act even on the
turn that you mount it.
In contrast, an independent mount-one that lets
you ride but ignores your control-retains its place
in the Initiative order and moves and acts as it likes.
FALLING OFF
If an effect is about to move your mount against its
will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10
Dexterity saving throw or fall off, landing with the
Prone condition (see the rules glossary) in an unoccupied
space within 5 feet of the mount.
While mounted, you must make the same save if
you're knocked Prone or the mount is.
UNDERWATER COMBAT
A fight underwater follows these rules.
IMPEDED WEAPONS
When making a melee attack roll with a weapon
underwater, a creature that lacks a Swim Speed has
Disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon
deals Piercing damage.
A ranged attack roll with a weapon underwater
automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's
normal range, and the attack roll has Disadvantage
against a target within normal range.
FIRE RESISTANCE
Anything underwater has Resistance to Fire damage
(explained in "Damage and Healing").
DAMAGE AND HEALING
Injury and death are frequent threats in D&D, as
detailed in the following rules.
HIT POINTS
Hit Points represent durability and the will to live.
Creatures with more Hit Points are more difficult
to kill. Your Hit Point maximum is the number of
Hit Points you have when uninjured. Your current
Hit Points can be any number from that maximum
down to 0, which is the lowest Hit Points can go.
Whenever you take damage, subtract it from your
Hit Points. Hit Point loss has no effect on your capabilities
until you reach O Hit Points.
If you have half your Hit Points or fewer, you're
Bloodied, which has no game effect on its own but
which might trigger other game effects.
DAMAGE ROLLS
Each weapon, spell, and damaging monster ability
specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage
dice, add any modifiers, and deal the damage to
your target. If there's a penalty to the damage, it's
possible to deal O damage but not negative damage.
When attacking with a weapon, you add your
ability modifier-the same modifier used for the attack
roll-to the damage roll. A spell tells you which
dice to roll for damage and whether to add any
modifiers. Unless a rule says otherwise, you don't
add your ability modifier to a fixed damage amount
that doesn't use a roll, such as the damage of a
Blowgun. See chapter 6 for weapons' damage dice
and chapter 7 for spells' damage dice.
CRITICAL HITS
When you score a Critical Hit, you deal extra damage.
Roll the attack's damage dice twice, add them
together, and add any relevant modifiers as normal.
For example, if you score a Critical Hit with a
RESTINC
Adventurers can't spend every hour adventuring.
They need rest. Any creature can take hour-long
Short Rests in the midst of a day and an 8-hour
Long Rest to end it. Regaining Hit Points is one
of the main benefits of a rest. The rules glossary
provides the rules for Short and Long Rests.
C H A PTER I I PLAY ING TH E GA. ME 2i
Dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage rather than ld4, and
add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves
other damage dice, such as from the Rogue's
Sneak Attack feature, you also roll those dice twice.
SAVING THROWS AND DAMAGE
Damage dealt via saving throws uses these rules .
DAMAGE AGAINST MULTIPLE TARGETS
When you create a damaging effect that forces two
or more targets to make saving throws against it at
the same time, roll the damage once for all the targets.
For example, when a wizard casts Fireball, the
spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught
in the blast.
HALF DAMAGE
Many saving throw effects deal half damage (round
down) to a target when the target succeeds on the
saving throw. The halved damage is equal to half
the damage that would be dealt on a failed save.
DAMAGE TYPES
Each instance of damage has a type, like Fire or
Slashing. Damage types are listed in the rules glossary
and have no rules of their own, but other rules,
such as Resistance, rely on damage types.
RESISTANCE AND VULNERABILITY
Some creatures and objects have Resistance or
Vulnerability to certain damage types . If you have
Resistance to a damage type, damage of that type
is halved against you (round down). If you have
Vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type
is doubled against you. For example, if you have
Resistance to Cold damage, such damage is halved
against you, and if you have Vulnerability to Fire
damage, such damage is doubled against you.
No STACKING
Multiple instances of Resistance or Vulnerability
that affect the same damage type count as only one
instance. For example, if you have Resistance to Necrotic
damage as well as Resistance to all damage,
Necrotic damage is reduced by half against you.
ORDER OF APPLICATION
Modifiers to damage are applied in the following
order: adjustments such as bonuses, penalties, or
multipliers are applied first; Resistance is applied
second; and Vulnerability is applied third.
For example, a creature has Resistance to all
damage and Vulnerability to Fire damage, and it's
within a magical aura that reduces all damage by
5. If it takes 28 Fire damage, the damage is first
reduced by 5 (to 23), then halved for the creature's
Resistance (and rounded down to 11), then doubled
for its Vulnerability (to 22).
28 CHAPTER l I PLAYING THE GAME
IMMUNITY
Some creatures and objects have Immun it y t o certain
damage types and conditions. Immunity to a
damage type means you don't take d am age of th at
type, and Immunity to a condition mean s yo u a r e n't
affected by it.
HEALING
Hit Points can be restored by magic , such as the
Cure Wounds spell or a Poti o n of Healing, or by a
Short or Long Rest (see the rules glossary).
When you receive healing, add the restored Hit
Points to your current Hit Points . Your Hit Points
can't exceed your Hit Point maximum, so a ny Hit
Points regained in excess of the maximum are los t.
For example, if you receive 8 Hit Points of healing
and have 14 Hit Points and a Hit Point maximum of
20, you regain 6 Hit Points, not 8 .
DROPPING TO O HIT POINTS
When a creature drops to O Hit Points, it either dies
outright or falls unconscious, as explained below.
INSTANT DEATH
Here are the main ways a creature can die instantly.
Monster Death. A monster dies the instant it drops
to O Hit Points, although a Dungeon Master can ignore
this rule for an individual monster and treat it
like a character.
Hit Point Maximum of 0. A creature dies if its Hit
Point maximum reaches 0. Certain effects drain life
energy, reducing a creature's Hit Point maximum.
Massive Damage. When damage reduces a character
to O Hit Points and damage remains, the character
dies if the remainder equals or exceeds their
Hit Point maximum. For example, if your character
has a Hit Point maximum of 12, currently has 6 Hit
Points, and takes 18 damage, the character drops to
0 Hit Points, but 12 damage remains. The character
then dies, since 12 equals their Hit Point maximum.
CHARACTER DEMISE
If your character dies, others might find a magical
way to revive your character, such as with the Raise
Dead spell. Or talk with the DM about making a new
character to join the group. The rules glossary has
more information on being dead.
f ALLING UNCONSCIOUS
If you reach O Hit Points and don't die instantly, you
have the Unconscious condition (see the rules glossary)
until you regain any Hit Points, and you now
face making Death Saving Throws (see below).
DEATH SAVING THROWS
Whenever you start your turn with O Hit Points,
you must make a Death Saving Throw to determine
whether you creep closer to death or hang on to life.
l<N0CKING OUT A CREATURE
When you would reduce a creature to O Hit Points
with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the
creature to 1 Hit Point and give it the Unconscious
condition. It then starts a Short Rest, at
the end of which that condition ends on it. The
condition ends early if the creature regains any
Hit Points or if someone takes an action to administer
first aid to it, making a successful DC 10
Wisdom (Medicine) check.
Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to an
ability score. You're in the hands of fate now.
Three Successes/Failures. Roll ld2O. If the roll is 10
or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success
or failure has no effect by itself. On your third
success, you become Stable (see "Stabilizing a Character"
below). On your third failure, you die.
The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive;
keep track of both until you collect three
of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when
you regain any Hit Points or become Stable.
Rolling a 1 or 20. When you roll a 1 on the d2O for
a Death Saving Throw, you suffer two failures. If
you roll a 20 on the d2O, you regain 1 Hit Point.
Damage at O Hit Points. If you take any damage
while you have O Hit Points, you suffer a Death Saving
Throw failure. If the damage is from a Critical
Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage
equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.
STABILIZING A CHARACTER
You can take the Help action to try to stabilize a
creature with O Hit Points, which requires a successful
DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
A Stable creature doesn't make Death Saving
Throws even though it has O Hit Points, but it still
has the Unconscious condition. If the creature takes
damage, it stops being Stable and starts making
Death Saving Throws again. A Stable creature that
isn't healed regains 1 Hit Point after ld4 hours.
TEMPORARY HIT POINTS
Some spells and other effects confer Temporary Hit
Points, which are a buffer against losing actual Hit
Points, as explained below.
LOSE TEMPORARY HIT POINTS FIRST
If you have Temporary Hit Points and take damage,
those points are lost first, and any leftover damage
carries over to your Hit Points. For example, if you
have 5 Temporary Hit Points and take 7 damage,
you lose those points and then lose 2 Hit Points.
DURATION
Temporary Hit Points last until they're depleted or
you finish a Long Rest (see the rules glossary).
THEY DON'T STACK
Temporary Hit Points can't be added together. If
you have Temporary Hit Points and receive more
of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you
have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell
grants you 12 Temporary Hit Points when you already
have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.
THEY'RE NOT HIT POINTS OR HEALING
Temporary Hit Points can't be added to your Hit
Points, healing can't restore them, and receiving
Temporary Hit Points doesn't count as healing.
Because Temporary Hit Points aren't Hit Points, a
creature can be at full Hit Points and receive Temporary
Hit Points.
If you have O Hit Points, receiving Temporary Hit
Points doesn't restore you to consciousness. Only
true healing can save you.
CONDITIONS
Many effects impose a condition, a temporary state
that alters the recipient's capabilities. The following
conditions are defined in the rules glossary:
Blinded Grappled Poisoned
Charmed Incapacitated Prone
Deafened Invisible Restrained
Exhaustion Paralyzed Stunned
Frightened Petrified Unconscious
The definition of a condition specifies what happens
to its recipient while affected by it, and some conditions
apply other conditions.
DURATION
A condition lasts either for a duration specified by
the effect that imposed the condition or until the
condition is countered (the Prone condition is countered
by standing up, for example).
No STACKING
If multiple effects impose the same condition on
you, each instance of the condition has its own duration,
but the condition's effects don't get worse.
Either you have a condition or you don't. The Exhaustion
condition is an exception; its effects get
worse if you have the condition and receive it again.
COMBAT AND
DAMAGE EXAMPLE
In this scene, threats force a group of adventurers
into battle. This example demonstrates the
turn-based flow of combat that gives each player
a chance to detail what they do during the highstakes
moments of a fight.
Below Castle Raven/oft, the characters enter combat!
Jared (as OM): Yellow lichen covers the ceiling in this
passage, which has alcoves along both sides.
Russell (as Shreeve): I peer into the nearest alcoves .
I Jared: They each contain human skeletal remains.
The silence is broken suddenly by the rattle of o
1
bones as the skeletons lurch to their feet all
around you and prepare to attack!
Russell: Ack! How many skeletons?
O Jared: Ten in all, and they're hostile . Roll Initiative!
Russell: Ten skeletons? Yikes! I got a 16.
Maeve (as Mirabella): I got 8.
Phillip (as Gareth): An incredible 2 for Gareth.
Amy (as Auro): I got a 19!
I Jared: The Rogue is quick to react-but not as quick
G) as the skeletons! They got a 20. The first four
I attack the person in the lead : Shreeve.
Russell: Oh, boy.
\ Jared: Their attack roll totals are 8, 16, 18, and 20 .
G) Russell: The 8 and 16 miss my AC, but the others hit.
l Jared: Two of them stick you with their broken
1 blades, dealing a total of 9 Piercing damage.
Russell: Is that the best you can do?
Phillip: Never say that to the OM.
Jared: Heh. Now two of them attack Auro. The first
roll is a natural l: a miss. The second roll is 16.
Amy: That hits.
Jared: You take 4 Piercing damage , and one of them
attacks Mirabella with a roll of 14.
0 Maeve: Hits . No, wait! I cast Shield, so that misses .
Jared: The skeleton ' s blade bounces off your shield
of magical force. Then two of them attack Gareth.
One misses with a S, but the other one lands a
solid blow with a 21, dealing 7 piercing damage .
Phillip: That got my attention!
Jared: That's nine attacks . There's one more skeleton
at the end of the hall. It moves up and waits for an
opening. Now it's Auro's turn.
Amy: I attack one close to me. Does a 24 hit?
Jared: A solid hit!
Amy: And it's next to one of my allies, right?
Jared: Yes.
G) Amy: So with my Sneak Attack, that's 22 damage!
Jared: Your blade slides into an empty eye socket,
and the skeleton clatters to the ground, now inanimate
and harmless.
~ Amy: Then I use Cunning Action to Disengage as a
'f Bonus Action and move 20 feet out of the melee .
Jared: Very good. Shreeve?
I Russell: I drop my sword and pull out my warhamG,
mer. Time to break some bones! My first attack i s
I a 21 to hit for 7 Bludgeoning damage.

damage is deadly to skeletons. Shreeve
knows this from past experience, which is

takes 14 damage.

Jared: Three if you don ' t want to get Shreeve too.
Maeve: That's probably best. I cast Thunderwave at
those three, using a level 2 spell slot . So there's
a loud boom, and a wave of thunderous force
sweeps over the skeletons . They need to make DC
15 Constitution saves.
Jared: They all fail!
Maeve: Because I used a level 2 slot, that's 15 Thunder
damage, and they're pushed 10 feet away.
Jared: They're pushed back and shattered.
Maeve: Excellent! Four down, six to go .
Jared: And it's Gareth's turn at last!
Phillip: How many of them are within 30 feet of me?
Jared: All six.

Holy Sun to sear these skeletons. They need to
make DC 15 Wisdom saves .
Jared (rolling): Oh, those are not good numbers.
None of them even got close.
Phillip: They each take 18 Radiant damage andJared:
Never mind the "and." Pelor does indeed
smite these skeletons! They're silhouetted for a
moment in a burst of brilliant light, then they vanish,
leaving only their broken swords behind .

Areas of Effect. Spells and many other effects
in the game fill a specific area that is
defined by the rules , like the 15-foot Cube of
the Thunderwave spell. See the r ules glossary
fo r more on areas of effect .
e ~;;;;;;;;;;;;;;========-
Saving Throws. The skeletons make Consti tution
saving throws to res ist the Thunderwave
spell. When they fail those saves, they
take damage and are pushed, as defined in
that spell 's description .
Damage and Hit Points. The skeletons have
13 Hit Points each, so the spells and attacks
in this example deal enough damage to destroy
them. If a spell or an attack dealt less
than 13 damage, the DM would keep track of
the damage each skeleton has taken until it
is reduced to O Hit Points and is de stroyed.
Saving Throws. Gareth's Sear Undead is a
class feature (see chapter 3). As with Mirabella's
Thunderwave spell, Sear Undead
forces the skeletons to make a saving throw.
CHAPTER 1 I PLAY I NG THE GAME 31

CHAPTER 2
T NG A CHARACTER
. -. ,, ;r OU CAN MAKE A CHARACTER FOR , r DUNGEONS & DRAGONS using the build-
_l. ing blocks in this book. Your character is a
combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks,
and your imagination. You choose a class (such as
Fighter or Wizard), a background (such as Sailor or
Acolyte), and a species (such as Human or Elf). You
also invent the personality and appearance of your
character. Once completed, your character serves as
your avatar in the D&D multiverse.
GET READY
Before you dive into character creation, there are a
few things to do to get ready, as explained below.
TALK WITH YOUR DM
Start by talking with your Dungeon Master about
the type of D&D game they plan to run. If the OM
draws inspiration from Greek myth, for example,
you might choose a different direction for your
character than if the OM is planning for swashbuckling
on the high seas. Think about the kind of
adventurer you want to play in this game. If you
don't know where to begin, look at the character
illustrations in this book for inspiration.
CHOOSE A CHARACTER SHEET
You'll record the main details of your character on
a character sheet. Throughout this chapter, we use
the term "character sheet" to mean whatever you
use to track your character's details, whether it's a
printed character sheet (like the one shown on the
following pages), a digital character sheet like the
one on D&D Beyond, or plain paper. Choose whichever
style of sheet works for you, and then embark
on creating a character!
SESSION ZERO
Some Dungeon Masters start a campaign with
a "session zero," an initial gathering focused on
creating characters and setting expectations,
including topics to avoid as well as those to
embrace. A session zero provides a great opportunity
to talk to the other players and the DM
and decide whether your characters know one
another, how they met, and what sorts of quests
the group might undertake together.
CREATE YOUR CHARACTER
Here are the steps to make a character; each step is
explored in detail in this chapter:
1: Choose a Class. Every adventurer is a member
of a class. A class broadly describes a character's
vocation, special talents, and favored tactics.
2: Determine Origin. A character's origin includes
two elements: background and species. How did
the character spend the years leading up to a life
of adventure? Who are the character's ancestors?
You can also choose your character's languages.
3: Determine Ability Scores. Much of what your
character does in the game depends on the character's
six abilities.
4: Choose an Alignment. Alignment is a shorthand
for your character's moral compass.
5: Fill in Details. Using the choices you've made, fill
in the remaining details on your character sheet.
On the character sheet on the following pages,
many spaces are labeled with a number that corresponds
with one of those steps.
STEP l: CHOOSE A CLASS
Choose a class, and write it on your character sheet.
The Class Overview table summarizes the classes.
See chapter 3 for the classes' details.

CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A CHARACTER 35
A BALANCED PARTY
The classic D&D party comprises a Cleric,
Fighter, Rogue, and Wizard. Those four classes
have the longest history in the game, but more
importantly, they bring a balanced mix of capabilities
to adventures. You ' re welcome to use that
party setup or modify it using these guidelines:
Cleric. Replace with Bard or Druid
Fighter. Replace with Barbarian, Monk, Paladin ,
or Ranger
Rogue. Replace with Bard or Ranger
Wizard. Replace with Bard, Sorcerer, or Warlock
WRITE YOUR LEVEL
Write your character's level on your character
sheet. Typically, a character starts at level 1 and
advances in level by adventuring and gaining Experience
Points (XP).
Write Your XP. Also record your Experience
Points. A level 1 character has O XP.
Starting at a Higher Level. Your DM might start
you at a higher level. If you start at level 3 or higher,
write your chosen subclass on your character sheet.
See the "Starting at Higher Levels" section later in
the chapter for more information.
NOTE ARMOR TRAINING
Your class might give you training with certain
categories of armor. Note your armor training on
your character sheet. Armor training with a kind of
armor means you can wear that armor effectively,
gaining defensive bonuses from it. The categories of
armor are described in chapter 6 .
HOLD THAT THOUGHT
You'll fill in more details about your class later.
Choosing your class is the most important decision
you make in creating a character, and it informs
many of the decisions you make in later steps. You'll
return to your class's description in chapter 3 several
more times before you're done.
STEP 2: DETERMINE ORIGIN
Determining your character's origin involves choosing
a background, a species, and two languages.
A character's background represents the place
and occupation that were most formative for the
character. The combination of background, species,
and languages provides fertile soil for your imagination

CHOOSE A BACKGROUND
Choose your character's background, and write it

Record Your Feat. A background gives you a feat,
which grants your character particular capabilities.
Feats are detailed in chapter 5. Write the feat on
your character sheet.
Note Proficiencies. Your background gives proficiency
in two skills and with one tool. Record this
information on your character sheet.
Your class also gives proficiencies. Check your
class description in chapter 3 and note the proficiencies
on your character sheet.
On the sample character sheet, you can indicate
proficiency in skills and saving throws by marking
the circle next to them.
The features table in your class description shows
your Proficiency Bonus (described in chapter 1),
which is +2 for a level 1 character. Note this number
on your character sheet. You'll fill in other numbers
connected to these proficiencies in step 5.
CHOOSE STARTI NG EQU I PMENT
Your background and class both provide starting
equipment. Any coins that you gain at this step can
be immediately spent on equipment from chapter 6.
In addition, you can have one trinket at no cost (see
the Trinkets table at the end of this chapter).
Record your chosen equipment on your character
sheet. Equipment is described in chapter 6, but for
now you can just write it all down and look up the
specifics in that chapter later. There's also space on
the sample character sheet to note any coins you
have left after purchasing your equipment, as well
as treasure you acquire on your adventures.
C HOOSE A .SPE" IES
Choose a species for your character. The following
species options are detailed in chapter 4: Aasimar,
Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling,
Human, Ore, and Tiefling. Once you've chosen a
species, write it on your character sheet. Then record
your species' traits.
Your character's size and Speed are determined by
the character's species; record these in the appropriate
places on your character sheet as well (you may
write just the first letter of your size).
IMAGINE YOUR PAST AND PRESENT
Let your character's background and species inspire
how you imagine their past. That past fed into the
character's present. With that in mind, consider answers
to the following questions as your character:
Who raised you?
Who was your dearest childhood friend?
Did you grow up with a pet?
Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom?
Did you join an organization, such as a guild or
religion? If so, are you still a member of it?
What elements of your past inspire you to go on
adventures now?
CHOOSE LANGUAGES
Your character knows at least three languages:
Common plus two languages you roll or choose
from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a
language means your character can communicate in
it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features
might also give you languages.
The Standard Languages table lists languages
that are widespread on D&D worlds. Every player
character knows Common, which originated in the
planar metropolis of Sigil, the hub of the multiverse.
The other standard languages originated with the
first members of the most prominent species in the
worlds of D&D and have since spread widely.

STEP 3: DETERMINE ABILITY SCORES
To determine your character's ability scores, you
first generate a set of six numbers using the instructions
below and then assign them to your six abilities.
Chapter 1 explains what each ability means.
GENERATE YOUR SCORES
Determine your ability scores by using one of the
following three methods. Your DM might prefer you
to use a particular one.
Standard Array. Use the following six scores for
your abilities: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
Random Generation. Roll four d6s and record the
total of the highest three dice. Do this five more
times, so you have six numbers.
Point Cost. You have 27 points to spend on your
ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on
the Ability Score Point Costs table. For example, a
score of 14 costs 7 of your 27 points.

Once you've generated six scores, assign them to
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma, keeping in mind your class's
primary ability. Fill in the ability modifiers as well.
If you're using the Standard Array option, consult
the Standard Array by Class table for suggestions
on where to assign scores for your character's class.
The table puts the highest scores in a class's main
abilities. If you used a different method to generate
the scores, you may still use this table to guide
where you place your highest and lowest scores.
BACKGROUNDS AND SPECIES
FROM OLDER BOOKS
Backgrounds in older D&D books don't include
ability score adjustments. If you're using a background
from an older book, adjust your ability
scores by increasing one score by 2 and a different
one by 1, or increase three scores by 1. None
of these increases can raise a score above 20.
Similarly, species in older books include ability
score increases. If you're using a species from an
older book, ignore those increases and use only
the ones given by your background.
Also, if the background you choose doesn't provide
a feat, you gain an Origin feat of your choice.

ADJUST ABILITY SCORES
After assigning your ability scores, adjust them according
to your background. Your background lists
three abilities; increase one of those scores by 2 and
a different one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None
of these increases can raise a score above 20.
Some players like to increase their class's primary
ability, while others prefer to increase a low score.
DETERMINE ABILITY MODIFIERS
Finally, determine your ability modifiers using the
Ability Scores and Modifiers table. Write the modifier
next to each of your scores.
ABILITY SCORES AND MODIFIERS
Score Modifier Score Modifier

DESCRIBE APPEARANCE AND PERSONALITY
Ability scores are an essential part of the rules, but
they can be more than that. Once you've assigned
your ability scores, give some thought to what those
scores might say about your character's appearance
and personality. A very strong character with low
Charisma might look and behave differently from a
charismatic character with low Strength. The following
tables of descriptive words give suggestions
of how you might describe your character based on
having a high or low score in an ability.
Note your character's appearance and personality
on your character sheet.

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational
thought don 't have alignments; they are un aligned.
Sharks are savage predators, for exam•
pie, but they aren't ev il; they are unaligned .
STEP 4: CHOOSE AN ALIGNMENT
Choose your character's alignment from the options
below, and note it on your character sheet.
D&D assumes that player characters aren't of an
evil alignment. Check with your OM before making
an evil character.
THE NINE ALIGNMENTS
A creature's alignment broadly describes its ethical
attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of
two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or
neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward
order (lawful , chaotic, or neutral).
The summaries of the alignments below describe
the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment;
individuals can vary from that behavior.
Lawful Good (LG) . Lawful Good creatures endeavor
to do the right thing as expected by society.
Someone who fights injustice and protects the innocent
without hesitation is probably Lawful Good.
Neutral Good (NG). Neutral Good creatures do the
best they can, working within rules but not feeling
bound by them. A kindly person who helps others
according to their needs is probably Neutral Good.
Chaotic Good (CG). Chaotic Good creatures act as
their conscience directs with little regard for what
others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron's
tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the
poor is probably Chaotic Good.
Lawful Neutral (LN). Lawful Neutral individuals
act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal
codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of
life- and isn't swayed either by the demands of
those in need or by the temptations of evil-is probably
Lawful Neutral.
Neutral (N). Neutral is the alignment of those who
prefer to avoid moral questions and don't take sides,
do ing what seems best at the time. Someone who's
bored by moral debate is probably Neutral.
Chaotic Neutral (CN). Chaotic Neutral creatures
follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom
above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land
living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral.
Lawful Evil (LE). Lawful Evil creatures methodically
take what they want within the limits of a
code of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploiting
citizens while scheming for power is probably
Lawful Evil.
Neutral Evil (NE). Neutral Evil is the alignment of
those who are untroubled by the ha r m they cause as
they pursue their desir es. A criminal who robs and
murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil.
Chaotic Evil (CE) . Chaotic Evil creatures act with
arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or bloodlust.
A villain pursuing schemes of vengeance and
havoc is probably Chaotic Evil.

STEP 5: FILL IN DETAIL~--
Now fill in the rest of your charac t er s h eet.
RECORD CLASS FEATURES
Look at your class's feature table in chapte r 3 , a n d
write down the level 1 features. T he cl ass fea tu res
are detailed in that same chapter.
Some class features offer choices. Make s ure to
read all your features and make any offered choic e s.
FILL IN NUMBERS
Note these numbers on your character sheet.
Saving Throws. For the sav ing throws you h a ve
proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the
appropriate ability modifier and note the total.
Some players also like to note the modifier for saving
throws they're not proficient i n , which is just
the relevant ability modifier.
Skills. For skills you have proficiency in, add your
Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated
with that skill, and note the total. You might a lso
wish to note the modifier for skills you're not proficient
in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.
Passive Perception. Sometimes your DM will determine
whether your character notices something
without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception)
check; the DM uses your Passive Perception instead .
Passive Perception is a score that reflects a general
awareness of your surroundings when you 're not
actively looking for something. Use this formula to
determine your Passive Perception score:
Passive Perception= 10 + Wisdom (Percept ion)
check modifier
Include all modifiers that apply to your Wisdom
(Perception) checks. For example, if your character
has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Perception
skill, you have a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2
for your Wisdom modifier+ 2 for proficiency).
Hit Points. Your class and Constitution modifier
determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1, as
shown on the Level 1 Hit Points by Class table.
LEVEL 1 HIT POINTS BY CLASS
Class
Barbarian
Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger
Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk,
Rogue, or Warlock
Sorcerer or Wizard
Hit Point Maximum
12 + Con . modifier
10 + Con. modifier
8 + Con. modifier
6 + Con . modifier
The character sheet includes room to note your
current Hit Points when you take damage, as well as
any Temporary Hit Points you might gain. There's
also space to track Death Saving Throws.
Hit Point Dice. Your class's description tells you
the die type of your character's Hit Point Dice (or
Hit Dice for short); write this on your character
sheet. At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die. You
can spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest to recover
Hit Points. Your character sheet also includes space
to note how many Hit Dice you've spent.
Initiative. Write your Dexterity modifier in the
space for Initiative on your character sheet.
Armor Class. Without armor or a shield, your base
Armor Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If
your starting equipment includes armor or a Shield
(or both), calculate your AC using the rules in chapter
6. A class feature might give you a different way
to calculate your AC.
Attacks. In the Weapons & Damage Cantrips
section of the character sheet, write your starting
weapons. The attack roll bonus for a weapon with
which you have proficiency is one of the following
unless a weapon's property says otherwise:
Melee attack bonus = Strength modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus
Ranged attack bonus= Dexterity modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus
Look up the damage and properties of your weapons
in chapter 6. You add the same ability modifier
you use for attacks with a weapon to your damage
rolls with that weapon.
Spellcasting. Note both the saving throw DC for
your spells and the attack bonus for attacks you
make with them, using these formulas:
Spell save DC = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus
Spell attack bonus= spellcasting ability modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus
Your spellcasting ability modifier for a spell is determined
by whatever feature gives you the ability
to cast the spell.
Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells. If your
class gives you the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature,
your class features table shows the number of
spell slots you have available, how many cantrips
you know, and how many spells you can prepare.
Choose your cantrips and prepared spells, and note
them-along with your number of spell slots-on
your character sheet.
NAME YOUR CHARACTER
Choose a name for your character, and write it on
your character sheet. The name can be whatever
you like. Was it the name of an ancestor? Does it
have religious or other significance? ls it a name
you chose for yourself?
CREATE FINAL DETAILS
As you finish creating your character, consider
whether you'd like to make up any other details
about the character. Here are the sorts of things
you might ask yourself as the character:
• What's your gender?
• What person or people do you care most about?
• What's your deepest fear?
On your adventures, will you seek knowledge,
wealth, glory, enlightenment, justice, mercy,
power, or something else?
LEVEL ADVANCEMENT
While going on adventures, your character gains
experience, represented by Experience Points (XP).
A character who reaches a specified Experience
Point total advances in capability. This advancement
is called gaining a level.
The Character Advancement table lists the XP
you need to advance to a level and the Proficiency
Bonus for a character of that level. When your XP
total equals or exceeds a number in the Experience
Points column, you reach the corresponding level.

GAINING A LEVEL
When you gain a level, follow these steps:
1: Choose a Class. Most characters advance in the
same class. However, you might decide to gain a
level in another class using the rules in the "Multiclassing"
section later in this chapter.
2: Adjust Hit Points and Hit Point Dice. Each time
you gain a level, you gain an additional Hit Die.
Roll that die, add your Constitution modifier to
the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your
Hit Point maximum. Instead of rolling, you can
use the fixed value shown in the Fixed Hit Points
by Class table.

.f.2 CHAPTER 2 I CREATI NG A C H A RACTER
3: Record New Class Features. Look at your class
features table in chapter 3 , and note the features
you gain at you r new level in that class. Make any
choices offered by a new feature.
4: Adjust Proficiency Bonus . A character's Proficiency
Bonus increases at certain levels, as shown
in the Character Advancement table and your
class features table in chapter 3 . When your Proficiency
Bonus increases, increase all the numbers
on your char acter sheet that include your
Proficiency Bonus.
5: Adjust Ability Modifiers. If you choose a feat
that increases one or more of your ability scores,
your ability modifier also changes if the new
score is an even number. When that happens, adjust
all the numbers on your character sheet that
use that ability modifier. When your Constitution
modifier increases by 1, your Hit Point maximum
increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
For example , if a character reaches level 8 and
increases their Constitution score from 17 to 18,
the Constitution modifier increases to +4. The
character's Hit Point maximum then increases by
8, in addition to the Hit Points gained for reaching
level 8 .
BONUS FcATS AT LEVEL 20
A DM can use feats as a form of advancement
after characters reach level 20 to provide greater
power to characters who have no more levels to
gain. With this approach, each character gains
one feat of their choice for every 30,000 XP the
character earns above 355,000 XP. Epic Boon
feats are especially appropriate for these bonus
feats, but a player can choose any feat for which
their level 20 character qualifies.
TIERS OF PLAY
With each new level, characters acquire new capabilities
that equip them to handle greater challenges.
As characters advance in level, the tone of
the game also changes, and the stakes of the campaign
get higher. It's helpful to think of a character's
(and a campaign's) arc in terms of four tiers of play,
describing the journey from a level 1 character just
beginning an adventuring career to the epic heights
of level 20. These tiers don't have any rules associated
with them; they point to the fact that the play
experience evolves as characters gain levels.
TIER 1 (LEVELS 1-4)
In tier 1, characters are apprentice adventurers,
though they are already set apart from the broader
populace by virtue of their extraordinary abilities.
They learn their starting class features and choose
a subclass. The threats they face usually pose a danger
to local farmsteads or villages.
TIER 2 (LEVELS 5-10)
In tier 2, characters are full-fledged adventurers.
Spellcasters gain iconic spells such as Fireball, Lightning
Bolt, and Raise Dead. Most weapon-focused
classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks
in a round. The characters now face dangers that
threaten cities and kingdoms.

TIER 3 (LEVELS 11-16)
In tier 3, characters have reached a level of power
that makes them special among adventurers. At
level 11, many spellcasters learn reality-altering
spells. Other characters gain features that allow
them to make more attacks or to do more impressive
things with those attacks. These adventurers
often confront threats to whole regions.
TIER 4 (LEVELS 17-20)
At tier 4, characters achieve the pinnacle of their
class features, becoming heroic archetypes. The
fate of the world or even the order of the multiverse
might hang in the balance during their adventures.
STARTING AT HIGHER LEVELS
Your DM might start your group's characters at a
level higher than 1. It is particularly recommended
to start at level 3 if your group is composed of seasoned
D&D players.
CREATING YOUR CHARACTER
Creating a higher-level character uses the same
character-creation steps outlined in this chapter
and the rules for advancing beyond level 1 provided
in the "Level Advancement" section. You begin with
the minimum amount of XP required to reach your
starting level. For example, if the DM starts you at
level 10, you have 64,000 XP.
STARTING EQUIPMENT
The DM decides whether your character starts
with more than the standard equipment for a level
1 character, possibly even one or more magic items.
The Starting Equipment at Higher Levels table is a
guide for the DM.
Also, check with your DM about what equipment
is available for you to buy with your starting money.
For example, the firearms described in chapter 6 are
too expensive for level 1 characters, but they might
be available for purchase if your DM allows them.

:!-!APTER~ I CREATING A CH A RACTER 4.3
MULTICLASSING
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple
classes. With this rule, you have the option of gaining
a level in a new class whenever you advance in
level instead of gaining a level in your current class.
Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes
to realize a character concept that might not be reflected
in a single class.
PREREQUISITES
To qualify for a new class, you must have a score
of at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class
and your current classes. For example, a Barbarian
who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must
have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher,
since Strength is the primary ability for Barbarians
and Wisdom is the primary ability for Druids.
EXPERIENCE POINTS
The Experience Point cost to gain a level is based on
your total character level, not your level in a particular
class, as shown in the Character Advancement
table in this chapter. For example, if you are a level
6 Cleric/ level 1 Fighter, you must gain enough XP
to reach level 8 before you can take your second
level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a Cleric.
HIT POINTS AND HIT POINT DICE
You gain the Hit Points from your new class as
described for levels after 1. You gain the level 1 Hit
Points for a class only when your total character
level is 1.
Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your
classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If these dice
are the same die type, you can pool them together.
For example, both the Fighter and the Paladin have
a dl0 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter/ level 5
Paladin, you have ten dl0 Hit Dice. If your classes
give you Hit Dice of different types, track them separately.
If you are a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin,
for example, you have five d8 Hit Dice and five dlO
Hit Dice.
PROFICIENCY BONUS
Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total character
level, not your level in a particular class, as
shown in the Character Advancement table. For
example, if you are a level 3 Fighter/ level 2 Rogue,
you have the Proficiency Bonus of a level 5 character,
which is +3.

PROFICIENCIES
When you gain your first level in a cl as s o the r th an
your initial class, you gain only some o f the ne w
class's starting proficiencies, a s detailed in each
class's description in chapter 3.
CLASS FEATURES
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features
for that level. A few features have addition a l
rules when you're multiclassing. Check the information
about multiclassing included in each of your
classes' descriptions .
Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting,
and features (such as Unarmored Defense) that give
you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.
ARMOR CLASS
If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor
Class, you can benefit from only one at a time. For
example, a Monk/Sorcerer with a Monk's Unar mored
Defense feature and a Sorcerer's Draconic
Resilience feature must choose only one of those
features as a way to calculate Armor Class.
EXTRA ATTACK
If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than
one class, the features don't stack. You can't make
more than two attacks with this feature unless you
have a feature that says you can (such as the Fighter's
Two Extra Attacks feature).
Similarly, the Warlock's Thirsting Blade invocation,
which grants you the Extra Attack feature
with your pact weapon, doesn't give you additional
attacks if you also have Extra Attack.
SPELLCASTING
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on
your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes
and partly on your individual levels in those classes.
Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more
than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass
but have the Spellcasting feature from only one
class, follow the rules for that class.
Spells Prepared. You determine what spells you
can prepare for each class individually, as if you
were a single-classed member of that class. If you
are a level 4 Ranger/ level 3 Sorcerer, for example,
you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you
can prepare six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 (as
well as four Sorcerer cantrips).
Each spell you prepare is associated with one of
your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of
that class when you cast the spell.
Cantrips. If a cantrip of yours increases in power
at higher levels, the increase is based on your total
character level, not your level in a particular class,
unless the spell says otherwise.

Spell Slots. You determine your available spell
slots by adding together the following:
9
l
l
l
l
• All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer,
and Wizard classes
Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and
Ranger classes
One third of your Fighter or Rogue levels (round
down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or Arcane
Trickster subclass.
Then look up this total level in the Level column of
the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots
for that level to cast spells of an appropriate level
from any class whose Spellcasting feature you have.
This table might give you spell slots of a higher
level than the spells you prepare. You can use those
slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a
lower-level spell that you cast, like Burning Hands,
has an enhanced effect when cast at a higher level,
you can use the enhanced effect as normal.
For example, if you are a level 4 Ranger/ level 3
Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 character when determining
your spell slots, counting all your levels
as a Sorcerer and half your Ranger levels. As shown
in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you have four
level 1 spell slots, three level 2 slots, and two level 3
slots. However, you can't prepare any level 3 spells,
A C>MRIICTER WITH PIILIIDIN /IND W11RLOCK LEVELS MIGHT CIILL
ON BOTH II MIGHTV 011TH /IND /IN OTHERWORLDLY PIITRON.
nor can you prepare any level 2 Ranger spells. You
can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the
spells you do prepare- and potentially enhance
their effects.
Pact Magic. If you have the Pact Magic feature
from the Warlock class and the Spellcasting feature,
you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic
to cast spells you have prepared from classes with
the Spellcasting feature, and you can use the spell
slots you gain from the Spellcasting feature to cast
Warlock spells you have prepared.

ARBARIANS ARE MIGHTY WARRIORS WHO
1 [) '\ are powered by primal forces of the multi-
} _ ~ verse that manifest as a Rage. More than a
mere emotion- and not limited to anger-this Rage
is an incarnation of a predator's ferocity, a storm's
fury, and a sea's turmoil.
Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce
spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection
to the pain and anguish of the world, as an
impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression
of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their
Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess,
but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.
Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders
in their communities. They charge headlong into
danger so those under their protection don't have
to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians
perfectly suited for adventure.

dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you
can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice.
You have the following effect options.
Forceful Blow. The target is pushed 15 feet straight
away from you. You can then move up to half your
Speed straight toward the target without provoking
Opportunity Attacks.
Hamstring Blow. The target's Speed is reduced by
15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can
be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a timethe
most recent one.
LEVEL 11: RELENTLESS RAGE
Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous
wounds. If you drop to O Hit Points while your Rage
is active and don't die outright, you can make a DC
10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your
Hit Points instead change to a number equal to
twice your Barbarian level.
Each time you use this feature after the first, the
DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long
Rest, the DC resets to 10.
LEVEL 13: IMPROVED BRUTAL STRIKE
You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The
following effects are now among your Brutal Strike
options.
Staggering Blow. The target has Disadvantage on
the next saving throw it makes, and it can't make
Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next
turn.
Sundering Blow. Before the start of your next
turn, the next attack roll made by another creature
against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An
attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.
LEVEL 15: PERSISTENT RAGE
When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended
uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage
in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a
Long Rest.
In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts
for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything
to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends
early if you have the Unconscious condition (not
just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy
armor.
LEVEL 17: IMPROVED BRUTAL STRIKE
The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to
2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal
Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike
feature.

If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving
throw is less than your Strength score, you can
use that score in place of the total.

feat of your choice for which you qualify.

PATH OF THE BERSERKER
Channel Rage into Violent Fury
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker

path is one of untrammeled fury, a nd they thrill in
the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize

you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on
your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine

to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together.
The damage has the same type as the weapon or
Unarmed Strike used for the attack.

conditions while your Rage is active. If you're

with your menacing presence and primal power.

30-foot Emanation originating from you must make
a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength
modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save,
a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute.
At the end of each of the Frightened creature's
turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect

use of it.

on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your
Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or be teleported

LEVEL 10: BATTERING ROOTS
During your turn, your reach is 10 feet greater with
any Melee weapon that has the Heavy or Versatile

you can also bring up to six willing creatures who
are within 10 feet of you. Each cFeature teleports to
an unoccupied space of yom:i choice within 10 feet
of your destination space.
PA~~-0 1: r-:i:-;:f, ZEALOT - - Rage
in Ecstatic Union with a God
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Zealot receive
boons from a god or pantheon. These Barbarians
experience their Rage as an ecstatic episode of
divine union that infuses them with power. They
are often allies to the priests and other followers of
their god or pantheon.
LEVEL 3: DIVINE FURY
You can channel divine power into your strikes. On
each of your turns while your Rage is active, the
first creature you hit with a weapon or an Unarmed
Strike takes extra damage equal to ld6 plus half
your Barbarian level (round down). The extra damage
is Necrotic or Radiant; you choose the type each
time you deal the damage.
LEVEL 3: WARRIOR OF THE GODS
A divine entity helps ensure you can continue the
fight. You have a pool of four dl2s that you can
spend to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can
expend dice from the pool, roll them, and regain a
number of Hit Points equal to the roll's total.
Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish
a Long Rest.
The pool's maximum number of dice increases by
one when you reach Barbarian levels 6 (5 dice), 12
(6 dice), and 17 (7 dice).
LEVEL 6: FANATICAL Focus
Once per active Rage, if you fail a saving throw, you
can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Rage Damage

with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of

until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use
of your Rage (no action required} to restore your
use of it.
LEVEL 14: RAGE OF THE GODS
When you activate your Rage, you can assume the
form of a divine warrior. This form lasts for 1 minute
or until you drop to O Hit Points. Once you use
this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a
Long Rest.
While in this form, you gain the benefits below.
Flight. You have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed
and can hover.
Resistance. You have Resistance to Necrotic, Psychic,
and Radiant damage.
Revivification. When a creature within 30 feet
of you would drop to O Hit Points, you can take a

change the target's Hit Points to a number equal to
your Barbarian level.

NVOKING MAGIC THROUGH MUSIC, DANCE, I ! and verse, Bards are expert at inspiring others, ll soothing hurts, disheartening foes, and creating
illusions. Bards believe the multiverse was spoken
into existence and that remnants of its Words
of Creation still resound and glimmer on every
plane of existence. Bardic magic attempts to harness
those words, which transcend any language.
Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards
are fascinated by almost everything. They become
masters of many things, including performing music,
working magic, and making jests.
A Bard's life is spent traveling, gathering lore, telling
stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences,
much like any other entertainer. But Bards' depth of
knowledge and mastery of magic sets them apart.

The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the
Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list
matches the number on the table. The chosen spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For
example, if you're a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared
spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in
any combination.
If another Bard feature gives you spells that you
always have prepared, those spells don't count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Bard spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your
list with another Bard spell for which you have spell
slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting
ability for your Bard spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Musical Instrument

po w er? Re cite dramatic monologues from
classic tragedies? Use the rhythm of a folk dance
to coordinate the movement of allies in battle?
Compose naughty li mericks?
When you play a Bard, consider the style of
ar tistic performance you favor, the moods you
might invoke, and the themes that inspire your
own creations . Are your poems inspired by moments
of natural beauty, or are they brooding
reflections on loss? Do you prefer lofty hymns or
rowdy tavern songs? Are you drawn to laments
for the fallen or celebrations of joy? Do you dance
merry jigs or perform elaborate interpretive choreography?
Do you focus on one style of performance
or strive to master them all?
LE V EL 4: AB I LIT Y SCOR E I M PROVEMENT

Whenever you reach a Bard level (including
this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the
Bard Features table increases, you can choose any
of your new prepared spells from the Bard, Cleric,
Druid, and Wizard spell lists, and the chosen spells
count as Bard spells for you (see a class's section for
its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a
spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with
a spell from those lists.
LEVEL 18: SUPERIOR INSPIRATION
When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses
of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have
fewer than that.

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify.
Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.

BARD SUBCLASSE S
A Bard subclass is a specializat ion t h at gran t yo u
features at cer t ain Bard level s, as specified in the
subclass. Bards fo r m loose a ssoc iations, whic h
they ca ll colleges, to p r es erve th eir tradit ions. T his
section presents the College of D a n ce, Coll ege o f
Glamour, College of Lore, and College o f Va lo r
subclasses.
COLLEGE OF DANCE
Move in Ha r mony w ith th e Cos mos
Bards of the College of Da nce know th at the Wor ds
of Creation can't be contained within s peech o r
song; the words a r e uttered by t he move ments of
celestial bodies and flow through the motions o f
the smallest creatures. These Bards pract ice a way
of being in harmony with the whir ling cosmos that
emphasizes agility, speed, and grace.
LEVEL 3: DAZZLING FOOTWORK
While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a
Shield, you gain the following benefits.
Dance Virtuoso. You have Advantage on any Charisma
(Pe r formance) check y ou make that involves
you dancing.
Unarmored Defense. Your base Armor Class equals
10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers .
Agile Strikes. When you expend a use of your Bardic
Inspiration as part of an action , a Bonus Action ,
or a Reaction, you can make one Unarmed Strike as
part of that action, Bonus Action, or Reaction .
Bardic Damage. You can use Dexterity instead
of Strength for the attack rolls of your Unarmed
Strikes. When you deal damage with an Unarmed
Strike, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to a
roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus your Dexterity
modifier, instead of the strike's normal damage.
This roll doesn't expend the die.
LEVEL 6: INSPIRING MOVEMENT
When an enemy you can see ends its turn within 5
feet of you, you can take a Reaction and expend one
use of your Bardic Inspiration to move up to half
your Speed. Then one ally of your choice within 30
feet of you can also move up to half their Speed using
their Reaction.
None of this feature's movement provokes Opportunity
Attacks.
LEVEL 6: TANDEM FOOTWORK
When you roll Initiative, you can expend one use
of your Bardic Inspiration if you don't have the
Incapacitated condition. When you do so, roll your
Bardic Inspiration die; you and each ally within 30
feet of you who can see or hear you gains a bonus to
Initiative equal to the number rolled.
L EVE L 14 : L E A DING E VASION
Wh en you are s ubjected to an effect that allows you
to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half
damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed
on the saving throw and only half damage if you
fail. If any creatures within 5 feet of you are making
the same Dexterity saving throw, you can share this
benefit with them for that save.
You can't use this feature if you have the Incapacitated
condition.
COLLEGE OF GLAMOUR
Weave Beguiling Fey Magic
The College of Glamour traces its origins to the beguiling
magic of the Feywild. Bards who study this
magic weave threads of beauty and terror into their
songs and stories, and the mightiest among them
can cloak themselves in otherworldly majesty. Their
performances stir up wistful longing for forgotten
innocence, evoke unconscious memories of longheld
fears, and tug at the emotions of even the most
hard-hearted listeners.
LEVEL 3: BEGUILING MAGIC
You always have the Charm Person and Mirror Image
spells prepared.
In addition, immediately after you cast an Enchantment
or Illusion spell using a spell slot, you
can cause a creature you can see within 60 feet of
yourself to make a Wisdom saving throw against
your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target has
the Charmed or Frightened condition (your choice)
for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success.
Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again
until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore
your use of it by expending one use of your Bardic
Inspiration (no action required).
LEVEL 3: MANTLE OF INSPIRATION
You can weave fey magic into a song or dance to
fill others with vigor. As a Bonus Action, you can
expend a use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic
Inspiration die. When you do so, choose a number
of other creatures within 60 feet of yourself, up to a
number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum
of one creature). Each of those creatures gains a
number of Temporary Hit Points equal to two times
the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die,
and then each can use its Reaction to move up to its
Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.
LEVEL 6: MANTLE OF MAJESTY
You always have the Command spell prepared.
As a Bonus Action, you cast Command without
expending a spell slot, and you take on an unearthly
appearance for 1 minute or until yo ur one •. 'ration
ends. During this time, you can ca t o,:-rn a nd
as a Bonus Action without expending a p eli s l t.
Any creature Charmed b y you automaticaily fai ls
its saving throw against the Command you cas t with
this feature .
Once you use this feature, you can't u se it aga in
until you finish a Long Rest. You can a lso re s tore
your use of it by expending a level 3 + s pell s lot (no
action required).
LEVEL 14 : UNBREAKABLE MAJESTY
As a Bonus Action, you can assume a m agica ll y
majestic presence for 1 minute or until you have the
Incapacitated condition. For the dura tion, whenever
any creature hits you with an attack roll for the
first time on a turn, the attacker must succeed on a
Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC,
or the attack misses instead, as the creature recoils
from your majesty.
Once you assume this majestic presence, you can't
do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
COLLEGE OF LORE
Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge
Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and secrets
from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes,
mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college's members
gather in libraries and universities to share
their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals
or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption,
unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important
figures of authority.
LEVEL 3: BONUS PROFICIENCIES
You gain proficiency with three skills of your
choice.
LEVEL 3: CUTTING WORDS
You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract,
confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and
competence of others. When a creature that you
can see within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage
roll or succeeds on an ability check or attack roll,
you can take a Reaction to expend one use of your
Bardic Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die,
and subtract the number rolled from the creature's
roll, reducing the damage or potentially turning the
success into a failure.
LEVEL 6: MAGICAL DISCOVERIES
You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can
come from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list or
any combination thereof (see a class's section for its
spell list). A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a
spell for which you have spell slots, as shown in the
Bard Features table.
Yo u a lw ays :1ave the c ho se n s pells prepared, and
w h ene ve r you ga in a Bard level, you can replace
o ne of the pelts w ith a nother s pell that meets these
requirem e nts .
LEVEL 14 : PEERLESS SKILL
When you make an ability check or attack roll and
fail. you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration;
roll the Bardic Inspiration die , and add the number
rolled to the d20 , potentially turning a failure into
a s uccess . On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn't
expended.
COLLEGE OF VALOR
Sing the Deeds of Ancient Heroes
Bards of the College of Valor are daring storytellers
whose tales preserve the memory of the great
heroes of the past. These Bards sing the deeds of
the mighty in vaulted halls or to crowds gathered
around great bonfires. They travel to witness great
events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of
these events doesn ' t pass away. With their songs,
they inspire new generations to reach the same
heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.
LEVEL 3: COMBAT INSPIRATION
You can use your wit to turn the tide of battle. A
creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you
can use it for one of the following effects.
Defense. When the creature is hit by an attack
roll, that creature can use its Reaction to roll the
Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to
its AC against that attack, potentially causing the
attack to miss.
Offense. Immediately after the creature hits a
target with an attack roll, the creature can roll the

LERICS DRAW POWER FROM THE REALMS
of the gods and harness it to work miracles .
Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another
immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine
magic of the Outer Planes- where gods dwell-and
channel it to bolster people and battle foes .
Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically
associate themselves with temples dedicated
to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked
their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely
on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers
and rites that help them draw on power from the
Outer Planes.
Not every member of a temple or shrine is a
Cleric . Some priests are called to a simple life of
temple service, carrying out their devotion through
prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mo r tals
claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal
the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.
BECOMING A CLERIC ...
As A LEVE L 1 CHARACTER
• Gain all the traits in the Core Cleric Traits table.
• Gain the Cleric's level 1 features, which are listed
in the Cleric Features table.
As A MULTICLASS CHARACTER
• Gain the following traits from the Core Cleric
Traits table: Hit Point Die and training with Light
and Medium armor and Shields .
Gain the Cleric's level 1 features, which are listed
in the Cleric Features table. See the multiclassing
rules in chapter 2 to determine your available
spell slots.
As a Cleric, you gain the following class features
when you reach the specified Cleric levels . These
features are listed in the Cleric Features table.
LEVEL 1: SPELLCASTING
You have learned to cast spells through prayer and
med itation. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting.
The information below details how you use
those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the
Cleric spell list later in the class's description.
Cantrips. You know three cantrips of your choice
from the Cleric spell list. Guidance, Sacred Flame , and
Thaumaturgy are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace
one of your can trips with another cantrip of your
choice from the Cleric spell list.
When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn
another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric
Features table.
Spell Slots. The Cleric Features table shows how
many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells.
You regain all expended slots when you finish a
Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of
level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from
the Cleric spell list. Bless, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt,
and Shield of Faith are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the
Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your
list matches the number on the table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Cleric, your list
of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1
and 2 in any combination.
If another Cleric feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don't count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Cleric spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared
spells, replacing any of the spells there with
other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting
ability for your Cleric spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a
Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.

Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must
make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails
its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated
conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries
to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This
effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage,
if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if
you die.

CLERIC SUBCLASSES
A Cleric subclass is a specialization that grants
you features at certain Cleric levels, as specified in
the subclass. Each Cleric subclass is named after a
domain of existence that is favored by a god, pan theon,
or religious order. This section presents the
Life Domain , Light Domain, Trickery Domain, and
War Domain subclasses.
LIFE DO MA IN
Soothe the Hurts of the World
The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that
helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who
tap into this domain are masters of healing, using
that life force to cure many hurts.
Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated
with this doma in, so a Cleric of almost any
religious tradition might choose it. This domain is
particularly associated with agricultural deities ,
gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and
community. Religious orders of healing also seek
the magic of this domain.
L E VE L 3 : DISCIPLE OF LIFE
When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit
Points to a creature, that creature regains additional
Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The
additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot's
level.
LEVEL 3 : LIFE DOM A IN SPELLS
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you
always have certain spells ready. When you reach
a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells
table, you thereafter always have the listed spells
prepared.
L I FE DOM A I N S P ELL S
Cleric Level Prepare d Spells
3 Aid, Bless, Cure Wounds,
Lesser Restoration
5 Mass Healing Word, Revivify
7 Aura of Life, Death Ward
9 Greater Restoration, Mass Cure Wounds
LEVEL 3: PRESERVE LIFE
As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol
and expend a use of yo ur Channel Divinity to evoke
healing energy that can restore a number of Hit
Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose
Bloodied creatures within 3 0 feet of yourself
(which can include you), and divide those Hit Points
among them. This feature can restore a creature to
no more than half its Hit Point maximum.
CHAPTE R 3 I CHARACTER CLASSES 73
LEVEL 6: BLESSED HEALER
The healing spells you cast on others heal you as
well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell
slot that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures
other than yourself, you regain Hit Points
equal to 2 plus the spell slot's level.
LEVEL 17: SUPREME HEALING
When you would normally roll one or more dice
to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or
Channel Divinity, don't roll those dice for the healing;
instead use the highest number possible for
each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit
Points to a creature with a spell, you restore 12.
LIGHT DOMAIN
Bring Light to Banish Darkness -
The Light Domain emphasizes the divine puwer to
bring about blazing fire and revelation. Clel'ics who
wield this power are enlightened souls infused with
radiance and the power of their deities' discerning
vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning
away darkness.
The Light Domain is associated with gods of
truth, vigilance, beauty, insight, and renewal. Some
of these gods are identified with the sun or as charioteers
who guide the sun across the sky. Others are
sentinels who pierce deception. Some are deities of
beauty and artistry who teach that art is a vehicle
for the soul's improvement.
LEVEL 3: LIGHT DOMAIN SPELLS
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you
always have certain spells ready. When you reach
a Cleric level specified in the Light Domain Spells
table, you thereafter always have the listed spells
prepared.
LIGHT DOMAIN SPELLS
Cleric Level Prepared Spells
3 Burning Hands, Faerie Fire, Scorching
Ray, See Invisibility
5 Daylight, Fireball
7 Arcane Eye, Wall of Fire
9 Flame Strike, Scrying
LEVEL 3: RADIANCE OF THE DAWN
As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol
and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to emit
a flash of light in a 30-foot Emanation originating
from yourself. Any magical Darkness-such as that
created by the Darkness spell-in that area is dispelled.
Additionally, each creature of your choice in
that area must make a Constitution saving throw,
taking Radiant damage equal to 2d10 plus your
Cleric level on a failed save or half as much damage
on a successful one.
LEVEL 3: WARDING FLARE
When a creature that you can see within 30 feet
of yourself makes an attack roll, you can take a Reaction
to impose Disadvantage on the attack roll,
causing light to flare before it hits or misses.

to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You

Radiance of the Dawn and any spell that deals Fire
or Radiant damage.
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and
you regain all expended uses when you finish a
Long Rest.
TRICKERY DOMAIN
Make Mischief and Challenge Authority
The Trickery Domain offers magic of deception, illusion,
and stealth. Clerics who wield this magic are
a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride,
mocking tyrants, freeing captives, and flouting hollow
traditions. They prefer subterfuge and pranks
to direct confrontation.
Gods of trickery are mischief-makers and instigators
who stand as a constant challenge to the
accepted order among both gods and mortals.
They embody the forces of change and social upheaval,
and they're patrons of thieves, scoundrels,
gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Religious orders
that operate in secret, especially those that seek to
undermine oppressive governments or hierarchies,
also draw on the power of the Trickery Domain.
LEVEL 3: BLESSING OF THE TRICKSTER
As a Magic action, you can choose yourself or a
willing creature within 30 feet of yourself to have
Advantage on Dexterity {Stealth) checks. This
blessing lasts until you finish a Long Rest or you use
this feature again.

Channel Divinity to create a perfect visual illusion
of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see
within 30 feet of yourself. The illusion is intangible
and doesn't occupy its space. It lasts for 1 minute,
but it ends early if you dismiss it (no action required}
or have the Incapacitated condition. The illusion
is animated and mimics your expressions and
gestures. While it persis ts, you ga in the foll ,,·. ;ng
benefits.
Cast Spells. You can cast spells as though ou
were in the illusion's space, but you mus t use your
own senses.
Distract. When both you and your illu sion are
within S feet of a creature that can see the illusion
you have Advantage on attack rolls aga inst that '
creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the
target.
Move. As a Bonus Action, you can move the illusion
up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can
see that is within 120 feet of yourself.
LEVEL 3: TRICKERY DOMAIN SPE LLS
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you
always have certain spells ready. When you reach a
Cleric level specified in the Trickery Domain Spells
table, you thereafter always have the listed spells
prepared.
TRICKERY DOMAIN SPELLS

LEVEL 6: TRICKSTER'S TRANSPOSITION
Whenever you take the Bonus Action to create or
move the illusion of your Invoke Duplicity, you can
teleport, swapping places with the illusion.
LEVEL 17: IMPROVED DUPLICITY
The illusion of your Invoke Duplicity has grown
more powerful in the following ways.
Shared Distraction. When you and your
allies make attack rolls against a creature
within 5 feet of the illusion, the attack rolls
have Advantage.
Healing Illusion. When the illusion
ends, you or a creature of your choice
within 5 feet of it regains a number of Hit
Points equal to your Cleric level.
WAR DOMAIN
Inspire Valor and Smite Foes
War has many manifestations. It can make
heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and
horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing
instances of excellence and courage. Clerics
\•;ho tap into th~ magic of the War Domain excel in
ba tt le, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offel'
ing ac ts of violence as prayers.
Gods of the War Domain watch over warriors and
reward them for their great deeds. They include
champions of honor and chivalry as well as gods of
destruction and pillage. Other war gods take a more
neutral st a nce, promoting war in all its manifestations
and supporting warriors in any circumstance.
LEVEL 3 : GUIDED STRIKE
When you or a creature within 30 feet of you
misses with an attack roll, you can expend one use
of your Channel Divinity and give that roll a +10 bonus,
potentially causing it to hit. When you use this
feature to benefit another creature's attack roll, you
must take a Reaction to do so.
LEVEL 3: WAR DOMAIN SPELLS
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you
always have certain spells ready. When you reach
a Cleric level specified in the War Domain Spells
table, you thereafter always have the listed spells
prepared.

modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended
uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to
cast Shield of Faith or Spiritual Weapon rather than
expending a spell slot. When you cast either spell
in this way, the spell doesn't require Concentration.
Instead the spell lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early
if you cast that spell again, have the Incapacitated
condition, or die.

Slashing damage.

elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and
wield elemental destruction.
Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain
their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both,
and they typically unite with other Druids to perform
rites that mark the passage of the seasons and
other natural cycles.
Druids a re concerned with the delicate ecological
balance that sustains plant and animal life and with
the need for people to live in harmony with nature.

many spell slots you have to cast your level l + spells.
You regain all expended slots when you finish a
Long Rest .
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of
level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from
the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship, Cure Wounds,
Faerie Fire , and Thunderwave are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the
Druid spell list until the number of spells on your
list matches the number on the table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots. For example , if you're a level 3 Druid, your list
of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1
and 2 in any combination.
If another Druid feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don't count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Druid spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared
spells, repl a cing any of the spells with other
Druid spells for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting
ability for your Druid spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as
a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.

LEVEL 2: WILD SHAPE
The power of nature allows you to assume the form
of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift
into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature
(see "Known Forms" below). You stay in that
form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid
level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated
condition, or die. You can also leave the
form early as a Bonus Action.
Number of Uses . You can use Wild Shape twice.
You regain one expended use when you finish a
Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when
you finish a Long Rest.
You gain additional uses when you reach certain
Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of
the Druid Features table.
Known Forms. You know four Beast forms for this
feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that
have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that
lack a Fly Speed (see appendix B for stat block options).
The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are
recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest,
you can replace one of your known forms with another
eligible form.
When you reach certain Druid levels, your number
of known forms and the maximum Challenge
Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the
Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8,
you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.
When choosing known forms, you may look in the
Monster Manual or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if
the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.
BEAST SHAPES
Druid Known Max Fly
Level Forms CR Speed
2 4 1/4 No
4 6 1/2 No
8 8 Yes
Rules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you
retain your personality, memories, and ability to
speak, and the following rules apply:
Temporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild
Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit
Points equal to your Druid level.
Game Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced
by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature
type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features;
languages; and feats. You also retain your skill
and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency
Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the
proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving
throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher
than yours, use the one in the stat block.
No Spellcasting. You can't cast spells, but shapeshifting
doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise
interfere with a spell you've already cast.
Objects. Your ability to handle objects is determined
by the form's limbs rather than your own.
In addition, you choose whether your equipment
falls in your space, merges into your new form, or
is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal,
but the OM decides whether it's practical for
the new form to wear a piece of equipment based
on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment
doesn't change size or shape to match the new
form, and any equipment that the new form can't
wear must either fall to the ground or merge with
the form. Equipment that merges with the form
has no effect while you're in that form.
LEVEL 2: WILD COMPANION
You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an
animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can
expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the
Find Familiar spell without Material components.
When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is
Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.
LEVEL 3: DRUID SUBCLASS
You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle
of the Land, Circle of the Moon, Circle of the Sea,
and Circle of the Stars subclasses are detailed after
this class's description. A subclass is a specialization
that grants you features at certain Druid levels. For
the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's
features that are of your Druid level or lower.
LEVEL 4: ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which
you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid
levels 8, 12, and 16.
LEVEL 5: WILD RESURGENCE
Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of
Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by
expending a spell slot (no action required).
In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape
(no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell
slot, but you can't do so again until you finish a
Long Rest.
LEVEL 7: ELEMENTAL FURY
The might of the elements flows through you. You
gain one of the following options of your choice.
Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier to
the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.
Primal Strike. Once on each of your turns when
you hit a creature with an attack roll using a
weapon or a Beast form's attack in Wild Shape, you
can cause the target to take an extra ld8 Cold, Fire,
Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you
hit).
LEVEL 15: IMPROVED ELEMENTAL FURY
The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows
more powerful, as detailed below.
Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Druid cantrip
with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell's
range increases by 300 feet.
Primal Strike. The extra damage of your Primal
Strike increases to 2d8.
LEVEL 18: BEAST SPELLS
While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in
Beast form, except for any spell that has a Material
component with a cost specified or that consumes
its Material component.
LEVEL 19: EPIC BOON
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify.
Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.

As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your
Wild Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of
yourself. Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining
thorns appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius
Sphere centered on that point. Each creature of
your choice in the Sphere must make a Constitution
saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6
Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much
damage on a successful one. One creature of your
choice in that area regains 2d6 Hit Points.
The damage and healing increase by ld6 when you
reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).
LEVEL 6: NATURAL RECOVERY
You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have
prepared from your Circle Spells feature without
expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long
Rest before you do so again.
In addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can
choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell
slots can have a combined level that is equal to or
less than half your Druid level (round up), and none
of them can be level 6+. For example, if you're a level
6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels' worth
of spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a
level 2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell
slots. Once you recover spell slots with this feature,
you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

Nature's Ward while ther e.
As a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to
60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself.
CIRCLE OF THE MOON
Adopt Animal Forms to Guard the Wilds
Druids of the Circle of the Moon draw on lunar
magic to transform themselves. Their order gathers
under the moon to share news and perform rituals.
Changeable as the moon, a Druid of this circle
might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the
treetops as an eagle the next day, and then crash
through undergrowth as a bear to drive off a trespassing
monster. The wild is in the Druid's blood.
L EVEL 3: C IRCLE FORMS
You can channel lunar magic when you assume a
Wild Shape form, granting you the benefits below.

you make before the end of this turn.
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and

you t e leport it to an unoccupied space you can see
within 10 fe e t of your destination space.
CIRCLE OF THE SEA
Become One with Tides and Storms
Druids of the Circle of the Sea draw on the tempestuous
forces of oceans and storms. Some view
themselves as embodiments of nature's wrath, seeking
vengeance against those who despoil nature.
Others seek mystical unity with nature by attuning
themselves to the ebb and flow of the tides, following
the rush of currents and waves and listening to
the inscrutable whispers and roars of the winds.
LEVEL 3 : CIRCLE OF THE SEA SPELLS
When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle
of the Sea Spells table, you thereafter always have
the listed spells prepared.

LEVEL 3: WRATH OF THE SEA
As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your
Wild Shape to manifest a 5-foot Emanation that
takes the form of ocean spray that surrounds you
for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no
action required), manifest it again, or have the Incapacitated
condition.
When you manifest the Emanation and as a Bonus
Action on your subsequent turns, you can choose
another creature you can see in the Emanation. The
target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw

C H A P TE R 3 I CHARACTER CLASS ES 87
LEVEL 14: OCEANIC GIFT
Instead of manifesting the Ema n ation of Wr ath of
the Sea around yourself, you ca n ma ni fe st it around
one willing creature within 60 fe et of you r self. That
creature gains all the benefits of the Emana tion and
uses your spell save DC and Wisdom modifier for it.
In addition, you can manifest the Emanation
around both the other creature and yourself if you
expend two uses of your Wild Shape instead of one
when manifesting it.
CIRCLE OF THE STARS
Harness Secrets Hidden in Constellations
The Circle of the Stars has tracked heavenly patterns
since time immemorial, discovering secrets
hidden amid the constellations. By understanding
these secrets, the Druids of this circle seek to harness
the powers of the cosmos.
LEVEL 3: STAR MAP
You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly
studies. It is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a
Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells. You determine
its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by
choosing one.
While holding the map, you have the Guidance and
Guiding Bolt spells prepared, and you can cast Guiding
Bolt without expending a spell slot. You can cast
it in that way a number of times equal to your Wisdom
modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all
expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour
ceremony to magically create a replacement. This
ceremony can be performed during a Short or Long
Rest, and it destroys the previous map.

2 A stone tablet with fine holes drilled through it
3 An owlbear hide tooled with stellar symbols
4 A collection of maps bound in an ebony cover
5 A crystal engraved with starry patterns
6 A glass disk etched with constellations
LEVEL 3: STARRY F ORM
As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your
Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form rather
than shape-shifting.
While in your starry form, you retain your game
statistics, but your body becomes luminous, your
joints gl immer like stars, and glowing lines connect
them as on a star chart. This fo rm sheds Bright
Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional
10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends
early if you dismiss it (no action required), have the
Inca pacitated condition, or use this feature again.
Whenever you assume your starry form, choose
which of the following constellations glimmers on
your body; your choice gives you certain benefits
while in the form.
Archer. A constellation of an archer appears on
you. When you activate this form and as a Bonus
Action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you
can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous
arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of
yourself. On a hit, the attack deals Radiant damage
equal to ld8 plus your Wisdom modifier.
Chalice. A constellation of a life-giving goblet
appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using
a spell slot that restores Hit Points to a creature,
you or another creature within 30 feet of you can
regain Hit Points equal to ld8 plus your Wisdom
modifier.
Dragon. A constellation of a wise dragon appears
on you. When you make an Intelligence or a
Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to
maintain Concentration, you can treat a roll of 9 or
lower on the d20 as a 10.
L EVEL 6: COSMIC OMEN
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can consult
your Star Map for omens and roll a die. Until you
finish your next Long Rest, you gain access to a special
Reaction based on whether you rolled an even
or an odd number on the die:
Weal (Even). Whenever a creature you can see
within 30 feet of you is about to make a D20 Test,
you can take a Reaction to roll ld6 and add the
number rolled to the total.
Woe (Odd). Whenever a creature you can see
within 30 feet of you is about to make a D20 Test,
you can take a Reaction to roll ld6 and subtract
the number rolled from the total.
You can use this Reaction a number of times equal
to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and
you regain all expended uses when you finish a
Long Rest.
L EVEL 10: TwINKLING CONSTELLATIONS
The constellations of your Starry Form improve.
The ld8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8,
and while the Dragon is active, you have a Fly Speed
of 20 feet and can hover.
Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while
in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation
glimmers on your body.
L EVEL 14: F ULL OF STARS
While in your Starry Form, you become partially
incor por eal , giving you Resistance to Bludgeoning,
Piercing, and Slashing damage.

a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool at
hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is
adept with every form of armor. Beyond that basic
degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain
styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery,
some on fighting with two weapons at once, and
some on augmenting their martial skills with magic.
This combination of broad ability and extensive specialization
makes Fighters superior combatants.

)_, \., "'- with the multiverse and focus their internal
reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize
this power in various ways: as breath, energy,
life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether
channeled as a striking display of martial prowess
or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed,
this power infuses all that a Monk does.
Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary,
even supernatural, effects. They channel
uncanny speed and strength into their attacks,
with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk's
hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated
implements of combat mastery.
Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic
withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and
mental focus they need to harness their power.
Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in
the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination
and discipline.
Monks generally view adventures as tests of their
physical and mental development. They are driven
by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than
merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure;
they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.

ALADINS ARE UNITED BY THEIR OATHS TO
stand against the forces of annihilation and
corruption. Whether sworn before a god 's
a lt a r, in a sacred glade before nature spirits, or in a
moment of desperation and grief with the dead as
the only witnesses, a Paladin's oath is a powerful
bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout
warrior into a blessed champion.
Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering
a variety of weapons and armor. Even so ,
their martial skills are secondary to the magical
power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite
t heir foes , a nd protect the helpless and those who
fight at their side.
Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an
adventuring life , for every Paladin lives on the front
lines of t he cosmic struggle aga inst annihilation.
Fighte rs are rare enough among the ranks of a
world 's a rmies , but even fewer people can claim the
calling of a Paladi n. When they do receive the call ,
th ese b lessed folk turn from their former occupat
ion s and take up arms and m a gic.

many spell slots you hav e to cast your level 1+ spells.
You regain all expended slots when you finish a
Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of
level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin
spells. Heroism and Sea ri ng Smite are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as
you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared
Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever
that number increases , choose additional
Paladin spells until the number of spells on your
list matches the number in the Paladin Features
table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots . For example, if you're a level 5
Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six
Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
If another Paladin feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don' t count
against the number o f spells you can prepare with
this feature , but those spells otherwise count as
Paladin spells for you.

absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign
of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of
forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.

talk to your DM. Your Paladin should probably
take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon
the class and adopt another one.

Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that

:P ::~LA DIN S UBCLASSES
A Paladin subclass is a specialization that grants
you fea tu res at certain Paladin levels, as specified
in the subclass. This section presents the Oath of
Devotion, Oath of Glory, Oath of the Ancients, and
Oath of Vengeance subclasses.
Each of these subclasses represents a body of
oaths that a Paladin begins taking upon j oining the
cl ass. The fin al oath, taken at level 3, is the culmination
of a Pal adi n's tra ining. Some characters with
this class don't consider themselves true Paladins
until they've reached level 3 and made this oath. For
others, the swearing of the oath is a formality, an
offici al stamp on what was already in their hearts.
OATH OF DEVOTION
Uphold the Ideals of Ju stice and Order
The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals
of justice and order. These Paladins meet the archetype
of the knight in shining armor. They hold
themselves to the highest standards of conduct,
and some- for better or worse- hold the rest of the
world to the same standards.
Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods
of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the
measure of personal devotion. Others hold angels as
their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings
into their helmets or coats of arms.
These paladins share the following tenets:
Let your word be your promise.
Protect the weak and never fear to act.
Let your honorable deeds be an example.
LEVEL 3: OATH OF DEVOTION SPELLS
The magic of your oath ensures you always have
certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level
specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you
thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
OATH OF DEVOTION SPELLS

of +1), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to
deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.
The weapon also emits Bright Light in a 20-foot
radius and Dim Light 20 feet beyond that.
You can end this effect early (no action required).
This effect also ends if you aren't carrying the
weapon.

You and your allies have Immunity to the Charmed
condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a
Charmed ally enters the aura, that condition has no

OATH OF GLORY
Strive for the Heights of Heroism
Paladins who take the Oath of Glory believe they
and their companions are destined to achieve glory
through deeds of heroism. They train diligently and
encourage their companions, so they're all ready
when destiny calls.
These paladins share the following tenets:
Endeavor to be known by your deeds.

you or another creature you can see within 10 feet
of you is hit by an attack roll, you can take a Reaction

OATH OF THE ANCIENTS
Preserve Life and Light in the World
The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the first elves.
Paladins who swear this oath cherish the light; they
love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world
more than any principles of honor, courage, and
justice. They often adorn their armor and clothing
with images of growing things-leaves, antlers, or
flowers-to reflect their commitment to preserving
life and light.
These paladins share the following tenets:
• Kindle the light of hope.
• Shelter life.
• Delight in art and laughter.

As a Magic action, you can expend one use of your
Channel Divinity to conjure spectral vines around
nearby creatures. Each creature of your choice that

condition for 1 minute. A Restrained creature repeats
the save at the end of each of its turns, ending
the effect on itself on a success.

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to
punish those who have committed grievously evil
acts. When evil armies slaughter helpless villagers,
when a tyrant defies the will of the gods, when a
thieves' guild grows too violent, when a dragon
rampages through the countryside-at times like
these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance
to set right what has gone wrong.
These paladins share the following tenets:
• Show the wicked no mercy.
• Fight injustice and its causes.

retreat. When you hit a creature with an Opportunity
Attack, you can reduce the creature's Speed to

Reaction. This movement doesn't provoke Opportunity

animal, drawing on primal magic and a deep connection
to the natu ral world.

You magically summon a primal beast, which draws
strength from your bond with nature. Choose its
stat block: Beast of the Land, Beast of the Sea, or
Beast of the Sky. You also determine the kind of
animal it is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat
block. Whatever beast you choose, it bears primal
markings indicating its supernatural or igin.
The beast is Friendly to you and your allies and
obeys your commands. It vanishes if you die.

action unless you take a Bonus Action to command
it to take an action in its stat block or some other

own and isn't limited to the Dodge action.

died within the last hour, you can t ake a Magic
action to touch it and expend a spell slot. The beast

their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper
hand in any situation. They have a knack for
finding the solution to just about any problem. A
few even learn magical tricks to supplement their
other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and
deception, while others refine skills that help them
in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding
and disarming traps, and opening locks.
In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over
brute strength. They would rather make one precise
s trike than we a r an opponent down with a barrage
of blows.
Some Rogues began their careers as criminals,
while others used their cunning to fight crime.
Whatever a Rogue's relation to the law, no common
criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle
brilliance of the greatest Rogues.

Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you

Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of
Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add

Daze (Cost: 2d6). The target must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it
can do only one of the following: move or take an
action or a Bonus Action.
Knock Out (Cost: 6d6). The target must succeed on
a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Unconscious

your level 1+ spells . You regain all expended spell

Whenever that number increases, choose additional
Wizard spells until the number of spells on your
list matches the number in the Arcane Trickster

can't cast it until the 8 hours have passed.
Once you steal a spell with this feature, you can't
use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

Any features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy
Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some
of your powers expend a Psionic Energy Die, as
specified in a power's description, and you can't use
a power if it requires you to use a die when your
Psionic Energy Dice are all expended.

Energy Dice when you finish a Short Rest, and
you regain all of them when you finish a Long
Rest.
Psi-Bolstered Knack If you fail an ability check using

into success. The die is expended only if the roll
then succeeds.

communication between yourself and others. As
a Magic act ion, choose one or more creatures you
can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your

Damage on a Hit: ld6 Psychic plus the ability modifier
used for the attack roll
Properties: Finesse, Thrown (range 60/120 feet)
Mastery: Vex (you can use this property, and it doesn't
count against the number of properties you can use
with Weapon Mastery)
The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or
misses its target, and it leaves no mark if it deals
damage.
After you attack with the blade on your turn, you
can make a melee or ranged attack with a second
psychic blade as a Bonus Action on the same turn if
your other hand is free to create it. The damage die
of this bonus attack is ld4 instead of ld6.

As a Magic action, you gain the Invisible condition
for 1 hour or until you dismiss this effect (no
action required). This invisibility ends early immediately

until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a
Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore
your use of it.
LEVEL 17: REND MIND
You can sweep your Psychic Blades through a creature's
mind. When you use your Psychic Blades to
deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can

(DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency
Bonus). If the save fails , the target has the Stunned
condition for 1 minute. The Stunned target repeats
the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success.

until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend three
Psionic Energy Dice (no action required) to restore
your use of it.

·- ORCERERS WIELD INNATE MAGIC THAT IS
stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can't
name the origin of their power, while others
trace it to strange events in their personal or family
history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a
baby's birth or the strike of lightning from a clear
sky might spark a Sorcerer's gift. So too might the
gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of
another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the
inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin,
the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a
churning magic that can be passed down through
generations.
Sorcerers don't learn magic; the raw, roiling
power of magic is part of them. The essential art of
a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that
innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new
and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers
master their innate magic, they grow more
attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers
that reflect its source.
Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce
exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most
of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke.
People who have this magical power soon discover
that it doesn't like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer's magic
wants to be wielded.

SORC ERER SUBCLASSES
A Sorcerer subclass is a specialization that grants
you features at ce1·tain Sorcerer levels, as specified
in the subclass. This section presents the Aberrant
Sorcery, Clockwork Sorcery, Draconic Sorcery, and
Wild Magic Sorcery subclasses.
ABERRANT SORCERY
Wield Unnatural Psionic Power
An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around
your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now
touch other minds with that power and alter the
world around you. Will this power shine from you
as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a terror
to those who feel the stab of your mind?
Perhaps a psychic wind from the Astral Plane
carried psionic energy to you, or you were exposed
to the Far Realm's warping influence. Alternatively,
you were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole,
but your transformation into a mind flayer never
occurred; now the tadpole's psionic power is yours.
However you acquired this power, your mind is
aflame with it.
LEVEL 3: PSIONIC SPELLS
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the
Psionic Spells table, you thereafter always have the
listed spells prepared.
PSIONIC SPELLS
Sorcerer Level Spells
3 Arms of Hadar, Calm Emotions,

7 Evard's Black Tentacles,
Summon Aberration

LEVEL 3: TELEPATH IC SPEECH
You can form a telepathic connection between your
mind and the mind of another. As a Bonus Action,
choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of
yourself. You and the chosen creature can communicate
telepathically with each other while the
two of you are within a number of miles of each
other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum
of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must
mentally use a language the other knows.
The telepathic connection lasts for a number of
minutes equal to your Sorcerer level. It ends early
if you use this ability to form a connection with a
different creature.
LEVEL 6: PSIONIC SORCERY
When you cast any level l+ spell from your Psionic
Spells feature , you can cast it by expending a spell
slot as normal or by spending a number of Sorcery
Points equal to the spell's level. If you cast the spell
using Sorcery Points, it requires no Verbal or Somatic
components, and it requires no Material components
unless they are consumed by the spell or
have a cost specified in it.
LEVEL 6: PSYCHIC DEFENSES
You have Resistance to Psychic damage, and you
have Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end
the Charmed or Frightened condition.
LEVEL 14 : REVELATION IN FLESH
You can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within
yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can spend 1 Sorcery
Point or more to magically alter your body for
10 minutes. For each Sorcery Point you spend, you
gain one of the following benefits of your choice,
the effects of which last until the alteration ends.
Aquatic Adaptation. You gain a Swim Speed equal
to hvice your Speed, and you can breathe underwater.
Gills grow from your neck or flare behind
your ears, and your fingers become webbed or you
grow wriggling cilia.
Glistening Flight. You gain a Fly Speed equal to
your Speed, and you can hover. As you fly, your skin
glistens with mucus or otherworldly light.
See the Invisible. You can see any Invisible creature
within 60 feet of yourself that isn't behind
Total Cover. Your eyes also turn black or become
writhing sensory tendrils.
Wormlike Movement. Your body, along with any
equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes
slimy and pliable. You can move through any space
as narrow as 1 inch, and you can spend 5 feet of
movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or
the Grappled condition.

imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order.
As a Magic action, you can expend 1 to 5 Sorcery

disorder around you. As a Magic action, you
summon the spirits in a 30-foot Cube originating
from you. The spirits look like modrons or other
Constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible
and invulnerable, and they create the effects below
within the Cube before vanishing. Once you use this
action, you can't use it again until you finish a Long

Repair. Any damaged objects entirely in the Cube
are repaired instantly.
Dispel. Every spell of level 6 and lower ends on
creatures a nd objects of your choice in the Cube.
DRACONIC SORCERY
Breathe the Magic of Dragons
Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon.
Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed
some of its magical power to you or your ancestor.
You might have absorbed magic from a site infused
with dragons' power. Or perhaps you handled a
treasure taken from a dragon's hoard that was
steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a
dragon for an ancestor.
LEVEL 3: DRACONIC RESILIENCE
The magic in your body manifests physical traits
of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum
increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you
gain another Sorcerer level.
Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like
scales. While you aren't wearing armor, your base
Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma
modifiers.
LEVEL 3: DRACONIC SPELLS
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the
Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have
the listed spells prepared.
DRACONIC SPELLS

LEVEL 6: ELEMENTAL AFFINITY
Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage
type associated with dragons. Choose one of those
types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.
You have Resistance to that damage type, and
when you cast a spell that deals damage of that
type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one
damage roll of that spell.
LEVEL 14: DRAGON WINGS
As a Bonus Action, you can cause draconic wings
to appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or
until you dismiss them (no action required). For the
duration, you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again
until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 3 Sorcery

of it.

LEVEL i i\: DRAGON C OMPANION
You can cast Summon Dragon without a Material
component. You can also cast it once without a spell
slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way
when you finish a Long Rest.
Whenever you start casting the spell, you can
modify it so th at it doesn't require Concentration. If
you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for
that casting.
WILD MAGIC SORCERY
Unleash Chaotic Magic
Your innate magic stems from the forces of chaos
that underlie the order of creation. You or an
ancestor might have endured exposure to raw
magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading
to Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you
were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon.
Or your magic could be a fluke with no
apparent cause. Whatever its source, this magic
churns within you, waiting for any outlet.
LEVEL 3: W ILD M AGIC SURGE
Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed
magic. Once per turn, you can roll ld20 immediately
after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot.
If you roll a 20, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table
to create a magical effect.
If the magical effect is a spell, it is too wild to be
affected by your Meta magic.
LEVEL 3: TIDES OF C H AOS
You can manipulate chaos itself to give yourself
Advantage on one D20 Test before you roll the
d20. Once you do so, you must cast a Sorcerer
spell with a spell slot or finish a Long Rest before
you can use this feature again.
If you do cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell
slot before you finish a Long Rest, you automatically
roll on the Wild Magic Surge table.
LEVEL 6: B END LUCK
You have the ability to twist fate using your
wild magic. Immediately after another creature
you can see r olls the d20 for a D20 Test, you can
take a Reaction and spend 1 Sorcery Point to roll
ld4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or
penalty (your choice) to the d20 roll.
LEVEL 14 : C ONTROLLED C HAOS
You gain a modicum of control over the surges of
your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild
Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either
number.

ARLOCKS QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE
that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse.
They often begin their search for
magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden
lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the
power of extra planar beings, or seeking places of
power where the influence of these beings can be
felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding
pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the
ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey,
demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far
Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to
bolster their own power.
Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as
means to the end of achieving magical power. Some
Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons;
some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek
to undermine their patrons even as they wield the
power their patrons have given them.
Once a pact is made, a Warlock's thirst for knowledge
and power can't be slaked with mere study.
Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater
power and deeper knowledge, which typically
means some kind of adventure .
BECOMING A WARLOCK
As A LEVE L 1 CHARACTER
Gain all the traits in the Core Warlock Traits
table.
Gain the Warlock's level 1 features, which are
listed in t he \A/arlock Features table.
As A MULTICLASS CHARACTER
• Gain the following traits from the Core Warlock
Traits table: Hit Point Die and training with Light
armor.
• Gain the Warlock's level 1 features, which are
listed in the Warlock Features table. See the multiclassing
rules in chapter 2 to determine your
available spell slots.
WARLOCK CLASS FEATURES
As a Warlock, you gain the following class features
when you reach the specified Warlock levels . These
features are listed in the Warlock Features table.
LEVEL l: ELDRITCH INVOCATIONS
; You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of
forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding
magical ability or other lessons. You gain one
invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome.
Invocations are described in the "Eldritch Invocation
Options" section later in this class's description.
Prerequisites. If an invocation has a prerequisite,
you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example
, if an invocation requires you to be a level S+
Warlock, you can select the invocation once you
reach Warlock level 5.
Replacing and Gaining Invocations. Whenever you
gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your
invocations with another one for which you qualify.
You can't replace an invocation if it's a prerequisite
for another invocation that you have.
When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain
more invocations of your choice, as shown in the
Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.
You can't pick the same invocation more than
once unless its description says otherwise.
LEVEL l: PACT MAGIC
Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact
with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers.
The entity is a voice in the shadows-its identity
unclear-but its boon to you is concrete: the ability
to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting.
The information below details how you use
those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the
Warlock spell list later in the class's description.
Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your
choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you
can replace one of your cantrips from this feature
with another Warlock can trip of your choice.
When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you
learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as
shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features
table.

Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows
how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock
spells of levels 1-5. The table also shows the level
of those slots, all of which are the same level. You
regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you
finish a Short or Long Rest .
For example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you
have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell
Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and
you cast it as a level 3 spell.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of
level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock
spells. Charm Person and Hex are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever
that number increases, choose additional Warlock
spells until the number of spells on your list
matches the number in the table. The chosen spells
must be of a level no higher than what's shown in
the table's Slot Level column for your level. When
you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock
spell, which can be of levels 1-3.
If another Warlock feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don't count
against the number of spells you can prepare with

you features at certain Warlock levels, as specified
in the subclass. This section presents the Archfey
Patron, Celestial Patron, Fiend Patron, and Great
Old One Patron subclasses.
ARCHFEY PAT RON
Bargain with Whimsical Fey
Your pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When
you choose this subclass, you might make a deal
with an arch fey, such as the Prince of Frost; the
Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming
Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an ancient
hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving
a web of favo rs and debts. Whoever they are,
your patron is often inscr utable and whimsical.
L EVEL 3: A RCH FEY SPELLS
The magic of your patron ensures you always have
certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level
specified in the Archfey Spells table, you thereafter
always have t he listed spells prepared.

9 Dominate Person, Seeming
LEVEL 3: STEPS OF THE FEY
Your patron grants you the ability to move between
the boundaries of the planes. You can cast Misty
Step without expending a spell slot a number of
times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum
of once), and you regain all expended uses when you
finish a Long Rest.
In addition, whenever you cast that spell, you can
choose one of the following additional effects.
Refreshing Step. Immediately after you teleport,
you or one creature you can see within 10 feet of
yourself gains ldlO Temporary Hit Points.
Taunting Step. Creatures within 5 feet of the space
you left must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
against your spell save DC or have Disadvantage on
attack rolls against creatures other than you until

You can cast Misty Step as a Reaction in response to
taking damage.
In addition, the following effects are now among
your Steps of the Fey options.
Disappearing Step. You have the Invisible condition

after you make an attack roll, deal damage,
or cast a spell.
Dreadful Step. Creatures within 5 feet of the space
you left or the space you appear in (your choice)
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against
your spell save DC or take 2d10 Psychic damage.
LEVEL 10: BEGUILING DEFENSES
Your patron teaches you how to guard your
mind and body. You are immune to the Charmed
condition.
In addition, immediately after a creature you can
see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction
to reduce the damage you take by half (round
down), and you can force the attacker to make a
Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC.
On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage
equal to the damage you take. Once you use this Reaction,
you can't use it again until you finish a Long
Rest unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no
action required) to restore your use of it.

until you finish a Long Rest.
FIEND PATRON
Make a Deal with the Lower Planes
Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of
perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon
lord such as Demogorgon or Orcus; an archdevil
such as Asmodeus; or a pit fiend, balor, yugoloth,
or night hag that is especially mighty. That patron's
aims are evil-the corruption or destruction of all
things, ultimately including you-and your path is
defined by the extent to which you strive against
those aims.

different one with this feature.
LEVEL 14: HURL THROUGH HELL
Once per turn when you hit a creature with an
attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the
target through the Lower Planes. The target must

several entities without yoking yourself to one.

mind and the mind of another. As a Bonus Action,

Traits table. ! I
• Gain the Wizard's level 1 features, which are listed
in the Wizard Features table . See the multiclassing
rules in chapter 2 to determine your available
spell slots.
WIZARD CLASS FEATURES
As a Wizard, you gain the following class features
when you reach the specified Wizard levels. These
features are listed in the Wizard Features table .
LEVEL 1: SPELLCASTING
As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to
cast spells . See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting.
The information below details how you use
l~~==================-======-1 , those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the
IZARDS ARE DEFINED BY THEIR
/; exhaustive study of magic's inner work-
• ings . They cast spells of explosive fire,
a r cing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular
transformations. Their magic conjures monsters
from other planes of existence, glimpses the future,
or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells
change one substance into another, call meteors
from the sky, or open portals to other worlds .
Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to
magic. They examine the theoreti~al ~nderpinnings
of magic, particularly the categorization of spells
into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as
Bigby, Tasha , Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built
on their studies to invent iconic spells now used
across the multiverse.
The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary
life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other
Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military
forces , or pursue lives of crime or domination.
But the lure of knowledge calls even the most
unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their
libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins
and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their
counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets
of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering
those secrets could unlock the path to a power
grea ter than a ny magic available in the present age.

CHAPTER 3 I CHARACTER CLASSES 171
WIZARD SUBCLASSES
A Wizard subclass is a specialization that gra nts
you features at certain Wizard levels, as specified
in the subclass. This section presents the Abjurer,
Diviner, Evoker, and Illusionist subclasses.
ABJURER
Shield Companions and Banish Foes
Your study of magic is focused on spells that block,
banish, or protect- ending harmful effects, banishing
evil influences, and protecting the weak.
Abjurers are sought when baleful spirits require
exorcism, when locations must be guarded against
magical spying, and when portals to other planes of
existence must be closed. Adventuring parties value
Abjurers for the protection they provide against a
variety of hostile magic and other attacks.
LEVEL 3: ABJURATION SAVANT
Choose two Wizard spells from the Abjuration
school, each of which must be no higher than level
2, and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new
level of spell slots in this class, you can add one
Wizard spell from the Abjuration school to your
spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a
level for which you have spell slots.
LEVEL 3: ARCANE WARD
You can weave magic around yourself for protection.
When you cast an Abjuration spell with a spell
slot, you can simultaneously use a strand of the
spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself
that lasts until you finish a Long Rest. The ward has
a Hit Point maximum equal to twice your Wizard
level plus your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you
take damage, the ward takes the damage instead,
and if you have any Resistances or Vulnerabilities,
apply them before reducing the ward's Hit Points.
If the damage reduces the ward to O Hit Points, you
take any remaining damage. While the ward has
0 Hit Points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic
remains.
Whenever you cast an Abjuration spell with a
spell slot, the ward regains a number of Hit Points
equal to twice the level of the spell slot. Alternatively,
as a Bonus Action, you can expend a spell
slot, and the ward regains a number of Hit Points
equal to twice the level of the spell slot expended.
Once you create the ward, you can't create it
again until you fini sh a Long Rest.
L EVEL 6: PROJECTED WARD
When a creature that you can see with in 30 feet of
yourself takes damage, you can take :; ~eaction to
cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If
this damage reduces the ward to O Hit Points, the
,.
"
warded c r eat ure takes a n y remaining damage. If
that creatu re h a s a n y Resis t a nces or Vulnerabilities,
apply them be fo r e reducing the ward's Hit Points.
LEVEL 10 : SPELL BREAKER
You always have the Counterspell and Dispel Magic
spells prepared. In addition, you can cast Dispel
Magic as a Bonus Action, and you can add your Proficiency
Bonus to its ability check.
When you cast either spell with a spell slot, that
slot isn't expended if the spell fails to stop a spell.
L EVEL 14 : SPELL RESISTANCE
You have Advantage on s aving throws against
spells, and you have Resistance to the damage of
spells.
DIVINER
Learn the Secrets of the Multi verse
The counsel of a Diviner is sought by those who
want a clearer understanding of the past, present,
and future. As a Diviner, you strive to part the veils
of space, time, and consciousness. You work to master
spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural
knowledge, and foresight.
L EV EL 3 : DIVINATION SAVANT
Choose two Wizard spells from the Divination
school, each of which must be no higher than level
2 , and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new
level of spell slots in this class, you can add one
Wizard spell from the Divination school to your
spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a
level for which you have spell slots.
L EVE L 3: PORTENT
Glimpses of the future begin to press on your
awareness. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, roll
two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can
replace any D20 Test made by you or a creature
that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls.
You must choose to do so before the roll, and you
can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.
Ea ch foretelling r oll can be used only once. When
you finish a Long Rest, you lose any unused foretellin
g r olls.
L EVE L 6 : EX P ERT D I VINATION
Casting Di v inat ion spells comes so easily to you that
it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts.
When you cast a Divination spell using a level
2+ spell slot, yo u rega in one expended spell slot. The
slot you r ega in must be of a level lower than the slot
you exp ended a nd can't be higher than level 5 .
LEVEL 10: THE THIRD EYE
You can increase your powers of perception. As a
Bo~us Action, choose one of the following benefits,
which lasts until you start a Short or Long Rest.
You can't use this feature again until you finish a
Short or Long Rest.
Darkvision. You gain Darkvision with a range of
120 feet.
Greater Comprehension. You can read any
language.
See Invisibility. You can cast See Invisibility without
expending a spell slot.
LEVEL 14: GREATER PORTENT
The visions in your dreams intensify and paint a
more accurate picture in your mind of what is to
come. Roll three d20s for your Portent feature
rather than two.
EVOKER
Create Explosive Elemental Effects
Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful
elemental effects such as bitter cold , searing fl ame,
rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning
acid. Some Evokers find employment in military
forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from afar.
Others use their power to protect others, while
some seek their own gain.
LEVEL 3: EVOCATION SAVANT
Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation
school, each of which must be no higher than level
2, and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new
level of spell slots in this class, you can add one
Wizard spell from the Evocation school to your
spellbook for free . The chosen spell must be of a
level for which you have spell slots.
LEVEL 3: POTENT CANTRIP
Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that
avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a cantrip
at a creature and you miss with the attack roll
or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the
cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip's damage
(if any) but suffers no additional effect from the
cantrip.
LEVEL 6: SCULPT SPELLS
You can create pockets of relative safety within
the effects of your evocations. When you cast an
Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you
can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1
plus the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically
succeed on their saving throws against the
spell, and they take no damage if they would normally
take half damage on a successful save.
LEVEL 10: EMPOWERED E VOCATION
Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evocation
school, you can add your Intelligence modifier
to one damage roll of that spell.
LEVEL 14: OVERCHANNEL
You can increase the power of your spells. When
you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1- 5
that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage
with that spell on the turn you cast it.
The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect.
If you use this feature again before you finish a
Long Rest, you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each
level of the spell slot immediately after vou cast it.
This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.
Each time you use this featu re agai.n before finishing
a Long Rest, the Necrot ic damaKe i'!'" spell level
increases by ld12.
,•
ILLUSI~ ;i tST __ _ _
Weave Subtl!' pel/s of Deception
You speciali ze in magic that dazzles the senses and
tricks the mind, and the illusions you craft make the
impossible seem real.
LEVEL 3 : ILLUSION SAVANT
Choose two Wizard spells from the Illusion school,
each of which must be no higher than level 2, and
add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new
level of spell slots in this class, you can add one
Wizard spell from the Illusion school to your spellbook
for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for
which you have spell slots.
LEVEL 3: IMPROVED ILLUSIONS
You can cast Illusion spells without providing Verbal
components, and if an Illusion spell you cast has
a range of 10+ feet, the range increases by 60 feet.
You also know the Minor Illusion cantrip. If you already
know it, you learn a different Wizard cantrip
of your choice. The can trip doesn't count against
your number of cantrips known. You can create
both a sound and an image with a single casting of
Minor Illusion, and you can cast it as a Bonus Action.
L EVEL 6: PHANTASMAL CREATURES
You always have the Summon Beast and Summon Fey
spells prepared. Whenever you cast either spell, you
can change its school to Illusion, which causes the
summoned creature to appear spectral. You can cast
the Illusion version of each spell without expending
a spell slot, but casting it without a slot halves the
creature's Hit Points. Once you cast either spell
without a spell slot, you must finish a Long Rest before
you can cast the spell in that way again.
LEVEL 10: ILLUSORY SELF
When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you
can take a Reaction to interpose an illusory duplicate
of yourself between the attacker and yourself.
The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion
dissipates.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again
until you finish a Short or Long Rest. You can also
restore your use of it by expending a level 2+ spell
slot (no action required).
LEVEL 14: J LLUSORY R EA LITY
You have learned to weave shadow magic into your
illusions to give them a semi-reality. When you cast
an Illusion Sf,dl with a spell slot, you can choose
one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the
illusion and n i; kc that object real. You can do this
on your tu r:, : , 'i a Bonus Action while the spell is ongoing.
The oi j'.•ct remains real for 1 minute, during
which it c :ir: '; c:eal damage or give any conditions.
For examp1r- . 1: u can create an illusion of a bridge
over a cha,;; n :.: nd then make it real and cross it.

CHAPTER 4
-I1 ARACTER ORIGINS
szc:;/ .
HI S CHAPTER DESCRIBES THE TWO
c omponents of an adventurer's origin: backg
round and species. Together, these elements
sugges t your character's early experience and
famil y origi n before taking up the adventuring life
and learning the capabilities of a class (described in
chapter 3) .
ORI GI N COMPONENTS
Ea ch part of your character's origin reflects facets
of your character, their life, and the circumstances
that started them on the path to adventure.
If you choose a background or a species from an
older book, s ee the sidebar "Backgrounds and Species
from Older Books" in chapter 2 for how to use
them with the options here .
C HA R AC TER BACKGROUNDS
Your character's background is a collection of characte
ristics that represent the place and occupation
t hat were most formative before your character embarked
on a life of adventure.
Ea ch background includes a brief narrative of
what your character's past might have been like . Alter
the deta ils of this narrative however you like .
PARTS O F A B A C K GROUND
A background includes the following parts.
Ability Scores. A background lists three of your
ch aracter's ability scores. Increase one by 2 and
another one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None of
these increases can raise a score above 20.
Feat. A bac kground gives you r character a specifi
ed Origin fe at (described in chapter 5) .
Skill Proficiencies. A background gives your charac
t er proficiency in two specified skills.
Tool Proficiency. Each backgr ound gives a characte
r profi cien cy with one t ool- e ither a specific tool
o r one c h osen fr om the Artisan's Tools category.
Tools are d etaile d in chapter 6.
Equipment. Each background offer s a choice between
a packa ge of equipment and 50 GP.
CHAR ACTE R S PE CIES
When you c h oose your character's species, you
deter mine whether your character is a human or a
me mb er of a fa ntastical species , such as dragonborn
o r g no m e.
The peoples of the D&D multiverse hail from different
worlds and include many kinds of sapient life
forms. A player character's species is the set of game
traits that an adventurer gains from being one of
those life forms .
Some species can trace their origin to a single
world, plane of existence , or god, while other species
first appeared in multiple realms at once. Whatever
a species' genesis, its members have spread
across the multiverse and contribute to many different
cultures .
Members of most species live for about 80 years,
with exceptions noted in the text about the species
in this chapter. Regardless of life span , members
of all species reach physical maturity at about the
same age. Your character can be any age that isn't
beyond their species' normal life span.
PARTS OF A SPEC I ES
A species includes the following parts.
Creature 'Iype. A character's species determines
the character's creature type, which is described in
the rules glossary. Every species in this chapter is
Humanoid; playable non-Humanoid species appear
in other D&D books.
Size. Your character's species determines the
character's size. Individuals within a species cover
a w ide range of heights, and some species include
such diversity of size that you can choose whether
your character is Small or Medium.
Speed. Your character's species determines the
character's Speed.
Special Traits. Each species gives a character
special traits-unique characteristics based on the
species ' physiology or magical nature. When you
choose a species, your character gets all the special
traits listed for it. Some traits involve making a
choice from a handful of options.

Once you were old enough to order an ale, you soon
had a favorite stool in every tavern within ten miles
of where you were born. As you traveled the circuit
from public house to watering hole, you learned to
prey on unfortunates who were in the market for
a comforting lie or two-perhaps a sham potion or
forged ancestry records.
You eked out a living in dark alleyways, cutting
purses or burgling shops . Perhaps you were part of

Your feet ache when you remember the countless
hours you spent at your post in the tower. You were
trained to keep one eye looking outside the wall,
watching for marauders sweeping from the nearby

searching for cutpurses and troublemakers.
You came of age outdoors, far from settled lands.
Your home was anywhere you chose to spread your
bedroll. There are wonders in the wildernessstrange
monsters, pristine forests and streams,
overgrown ruins of great halls once trod by giantsand
you learned to fend for yourself as you explored
them. From time to time, you guided friendly nature
priests who instructed you in the fundamentals of
channeling the magic of the wild.

You spent your early years secluded in a hut or
mon astery located well beyond the outskirts of the
nearest settlement. In those days, your only companions
were the creatures of the forest and those
who would occasionally visit to bring news of the
outside world and suppl ie s . The solitude allowed
you to spend many hours pondering the mysteries
of creation.
You were apprenticed to a trader, caravan master,
or shopkeeper, learning the fundamentals of commerce.
You traveled broadly, and you earned a living
by buying and selling the raw materials artisans
need to practice their craft or fini shed works from
such crafters. You might have transpvr t ed goods
from one place to another (by shi p, v, ago n, or caravan)
or bought them from trave li n g 1 ··;,de rs and sold
them in your own shop.

You were raised in a castle, surrounded by wealth,
power, and privilege . Your family of minor aristocrats
ensured that you received a first-class education,
some of which you appreciated and some
of which you resented . Your time in the castle,
especially the many hours you spent observing your
family at court, also taught you a great deal about
leadership.
You spent your formative years traveling between
manors and monasteries, performing various odd
jobs and services in exchange for access to their
libraries. You whiled away many a long evening
studying books and scrolls, learning the lore of the
multiverse-even the rudiments of magic-and your
mind yearns for more.

You began training for war as soon as you reached
adulthood and carry precious few memories of life
before you took up arms. Battle is in your blood.
Sometimes you catch yourself reflexively performing
the basic fighting exercises you learned first.
Eventually, you put that training to use on the battlefield,
protecting the realm by waging war.
You grew up on the streets surrounded by similarly
ill - fated castoffs, a few of them friends and a few of
them rivals. You slept where you could and did odd
jobs for food . At times, when the hunger became
unbearable, you resorted to theft. Still, you never
lost your pride and never abandoned hope. Fate is
not yet finished with you.
SPECIES DESCRIPTIONS
Ten species are presented in this section in alphabetical
order: Aasimar, Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf,
Gnome, Goliath, Halfling, Human, Ore, and Tiefling.
A.ASIMAR
Aasimar (pronounced AH-sih-mar) are mortals
who carry a spark of the Upper Planes within their
souls. Whether descended from an angelic being or
infused with celestial power, they can fan that spark
to bring light, healing, and heavenly fury.
Aasimar can arise among any population of
mortals. They resemble their parents, but they live
for up to 160 years and have features that hint at
their celestial heritage, such as metallic freckles ,
luminous eyes, a halo, or the skin color of an angel
(silver, opalescent green, or coppery red). These
features start subtle and become obvious when the
aasimar learns to reveal their full celestial nature.
AASIMAR TRAITS
Creature Type: Humanoid
Size: Medium (about 4- 7 feet tall) or Small (about 2-4
feet tall), chosen when you select this species
Speed: 30 feet
As an Aasimar, you have these special traits.
Celestial Resistance. You have Resistance to Necrotic
damage and Radiant damage.
Darkvision. You have Darkvision with a range of
60 feet.
Healing Hands. As a Magic action, you touch a
creature and roll a number of d4s equal to your
Proficiency Bonus. The creature regains a number
of Hit Points equal to the total rolled. Once you use
this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a
Long Rest.
TRh CHAPTER 4 I CHARACTER OR IGINS
Light Bearer. You know the Light can trip. '~ !1arisma
is your spellcasting abili ty for it.
Celestial Revelation. When you reach ch:cHacter
level 3, you can transform as a Bonus Action usi ng
one of the options below (choose t he option each
time you transform). The tra nsforma ti on lasts for
1 minute or until you end it (no act ion required).
Once you transform , you ca n't do so aga in unt il you
finish a Long Rest.
Once on each of your turns before the t ra nsformation
ends, you ca n dea l extra damage to one t arget
when you deal damage to it with an attack or a
spell. The extra damage equa ls your Pro ficiency Bonus,
and the extra damage's type is eith er Necrotic
for Necrotic Shroud or Radiant fo r Heavenly Wings
and Inner Radi ance.
Here are the transformation options:
Heavenly Wings. Two spectral wings sprout from
your back temporarily. Until the transformation
ends, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed.
Inner Radiance. Searing light temporarily radiates
from your eyes and mouth. For the duration , you
shed Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim
Light for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of
each of your turns, each creature within 10 feet
of you takes Radiant damage equal to your Proficiency
Bonus.
Necrotic Shroud. Your eyes briefly become pools
of darkness, and flightless wings sprout from your
back temporarily. Creatures other than your allies
within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Charisma
saving throw (DC 8 plus your Charisma modifier
and Proficiency Bonus) or have the Frightened
condition until the end of your next turn.
DRAGONBORN
The ancestors of dragonborn hatched from the
eggs of chromatic and metallic dragons. One story
holds that these eggs were blessed by the dragon
gods Bahamut and Tiamat, who wanted to populate
the multiverse with people created in their image.
Another story claims that dragons created the first
dragonborn without the gods' blessings. Whatever
their origin, dragonborn have made homes for
themselves on the Material Plane.
Dragonborn look like wingless, bipedal dragonsscaly,
bright-eyed, and thick-boned with horns on
their heads-and their coloration and other features
are reminiscent of their draconic ancestors.
DRAGONBORN TRAITS
Creature Type: Humanoid
Size: Medium (about 5-7 feet tall)
Speed: 30 feet
As a Dragonborn, you have these special traits.
Draconic Ancestry. Your lineage stems from a

area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8
plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus).
On a failed save, a creature takes ldl0 damage
of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry
trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as
much damage. This damage increases by ldlO when
you reach character levels S (2d10), 11 {3d10), and

or until you retract the wings (no action required)
or have the Incapacitated condition. During that
time, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed.
Your wings appear to be made of the same energy
as your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you
can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
CHAPTER 4 I CHARACTER ORIG INS 187
DWARF
Dwarves were raised from the earth in the elder
days by a deity of the forge. Called by various
names on different worlds-Morad in, Reorx, and
others-that god gave dwarves an affinity for stone
and metal and for living underground . The god also
made them resilient like the mountains, with a life
span of about 350 years.
Squat and often bearded, the original dwarves
carved cities and strongholds into mountainsides
and under the earth. Their oldest legends tell of
conflicts with the monsters of mountaintops and
the Underdark, whether those monsters were towering
giants or subterranean horrors. Inspired by
those tales, dwarves of any culture often sing of valorous
deeds-especially of the little overcoming the
mighty.
On some worlds in the multiverse, the first settlements
of dwarves were built in hills or mountains,
and the families who trace their ancestry to those
settlements call themselves hill dwarves or mountain
dwarves, respectively. The Greyhawk and
Dragonlance settings have such communities.

You must be on a stone surface or touching a stone
surface to use this Tremorsense. The stone can be
natural or worked.
You can use this Bonus Action a numbe r of times
equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all
expended uses when you fini s h a Lon b Re s t.
ELF
Created by the god Corellon, the first elves could
change their forms at will. They lost this ability
when Corellon cursed them for plotting with the
deity Lolth, who tried and failed to usurp Corellon's
dominion . When Lolth was cast into the Abyss,
mo st elves renounced her and earned Corellon's forgiveness,
but that which Corellon had taken from
them was lost forever.
No longer able to shape -shift at will, the elves
retreated to the Feywild, where their sorrow was
deepened by that plane's influence. Over time, curiosity
led many of them to explore other planes of
existence, including worlds in the Material Plane.
Elves have pointed ears and lack facial and body
hair. They live for around 750 years, and they don't
sleep but instead enter a trance when they need to
rest. In that state, they remain aware of their surroundings
while immersing themselves in memories
and meditations.
An environment subtly transforms elves after
they inhabit it fo r a millennium or more, and it
grants them cer t a in kinds of magic. Drow, high
elves, and w o o d elves are examples of elves who
have been trans fo rmed thus.
DROW
Drow typically dwell in the Underdark and have
been shaped by it. Some drow individuals and societies
avoid the Underdark altogether yet carry its
magic. In the Eberron setting, for example, drow
dwell in rainforests and cyclopean ruins on the continent
of Xen'drik.
HIGH ELVES
High elves have been infused with the magic of
crossings between the FeY'vild and the Material
Plane. On some worlds, high elves refer to themselves
by other names. For example, they call themselves
sun or moon elves in the Forgotten Realms
setting, Silvanesti and Qualinesti in the Dragonlance
setting, and Aereni in the Eberron setting.
Woon ELVES
Wood elves carry the magic of primeval forests
within themselves. They are known by many other
names, including wild elves, green elves, and forest
elves. Grugach are reclusive wood elves of the Greyhawk
setting, while the Kagonesti and the Tairnadal
are wood elves of the Dragonlance and Eberron settings,
respectively.

GNOME
Gnomes are magical folk created by gods of invention,
illusions, and life underground. The earliest
gnomes were seldom seen by other folk due to the
gnomes' secretive nature and their propensity for
living in forests and burrows. What they lacked
in size, they made up for in cleverness. They confounded
predators with traps and labyrinthine
tunnels. They also learned magic from gods like
Gari Glittergold, Baervan Wildwanderer, and Baravar
Cloakshadow, who visited them in disguise.
That magic eventually created the lineages of forest
gnomes and rock gnomes.
Gnomes are petite folk with big eyes and pointed
ears, who live around 425 years. Many gnomes like
the feeling of a roof over their head, even if that
"roof" is nothing more than a hat.
G NOME T RAITS
Creature Type: Humanoid
Size: Small (about 3-4 feet tall)
Speed: 30 feet
As a Gnome, you have these special traits.
Darkvision. You have Darkvision with a range of
60 feet.
Gnomish Cunning. You have Advantage on Intelligence,
Wisde n, , and Charisma saving th rows.
Gnomish Lineage. You are part of a lineage that
gra nts you upernatural abilities. Choose one of
the following o )t ions; whichever one you choose,
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting
ability for the spells you cast with this trait
(choose the ability when you select the lineage):
Forest Gnome. You know the Minor Illusion cantrip.
You also always have the Speak with Animals spell
prepared. You can cast it without a spell slot a
number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus,
and you regain all expended uses when you finish
a Long Rest. You can also use any spell slots you
have to cast the spell.
Rock Gnome. You know the Mending and Prestidigitation
cantrips. In addition, you can spend 10
minutes casting Prestidigitation to create a Tiny
clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP}, such as a toy, fire
starter, or music box. When you create the device,
you determine its function by choosing one effect
from Prestidigitation; the device produces that
effect whenever you or another creature takes
a Bonus Action to activate it with a touch. If the
chosen effect has options within it, you choose
one of those options for the device when you
create it. For example, if you choose the spell's
ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether
the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device
doesn't do both. You can have three such devices
in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours
after its creation or when you dismantle it with a
touch as a Utilize action.
CHAPTER 4 I CHA RACTER OR IGI NS 191
GOLIATH
Towering over most folk, goliaths are distant de scendants
of giants. Each goliath bears the favors
of the first giants-favors that manifest in various
supernatural boons , including the ability to quickly
grow and temporarily approach the height of goliaths'
gigantic kin.
Goliaths have physical characteristics that are
reminiscent of the giants in their family lines. For
example, some goliaths look like stone giants, while
others resemble fire giants. Whatever giants they
count as kin, goliaths have forged their own path in
the multiverse-unencumbered by the internecine
conflicts that have ravaged giantkind for ages-and
seek heights above those reached by their ancestors.

HALFLING
Cherished and guided by gods who value life, home ,
and hearth, halflings gravitate toward bucolic havens
where family and community help shape their
lives. That said, many halflings possess a brave and
adventurous spirit that leads them on journeys of
discovery, affording them the chance to explore a
bigger world and make new friends along the way.
Their size - similar to that of a human child-helps
them pass through crowds unnoticed and slip
through tight spaces.
Anyone who has spent time around halflings, particularly
halfling adventurers , has likely witnessed
the storied "luck of the halflings" in action. When a
halfling is in mortal danger, an unseen force seems
to intervene on the halfling's behalf. Many halflings
believe in the power of luck, and they attribute their
unusual gift to one or more of their benevolent
gods, including Yondalla, Brandobaris, and Charmalaine.
The same gift might contribute to their robust
life spans (about 150 years).
Halfling communities come in all varieties. For every
sequeste red shire tucked away in an unspoiled
part of the world, there's a crime syndicate like the
Boromar Clan in the Eberron setting or a territorial
mob of halflings like those in the Dark Sun setting.
Halflings who prefer to live underground are
sometimes called strongheart halflings or stouts.
Nomadic halflings, as well as those who live among
humans and other tall folk, are sometimes called
lightfoot halflings or tallfellows .
HALFLING TRAITS
Creature Type: Humanoid
Size: Small (about 2-3 feet tall)
Speed: 30 feet
As a Halfling, you have these special traits.
Brave. You have Advantage on saving throws you
make to avoid or end the Frightened condition.
Hal.fling Nimbleness. You can move through the
space of any creature that is a size larger than you,
but you can't stop in the same space.
Luck. When you roll a 1 on the d2O of a D2O Test,
you can reroll the die, and you must use the new
roll.
Naturally Stealthy. You can take the Hide action
even when you are obscured only by a creature that
is at least one size larger than you.

HUMAN
Found throughout the multiverse, humans are as
varied as they are numerous, and they endeavor to
achieve as much as they can in the years they are
given. Their ambition and resourcefulness are commended,
respected, and feared on many worlds.
Humans are as diverse in appearance as the
people of Earth, and they have many gods. Scholars
dispute the origin of humanity, but one of the
earliest known human gatherings is said to have
occurred in Sigil, the torus-shaped city at the center
of the multi verse and the place where the Common
language was born. From there, humans could have
spread to every part of the multiverse, bringing the
City of Doors' cosmopolitanism with them.

ORC
Ores trace their creation to Gruumsh, a powerful
god who roamed the wide open spaces of the Material
Plane. Gruumsh equipped his children with gifts
to help them wander great plains, vast caverns, and
churning seas and to face the monsters that lurk
there. Even when they turn their devotion to other
gods, ores retain Gruumsh's gifts: endurance, determination,
and the ability to see in darkness.
Ores are, on average, tall and broad. They have
gray skin, ears that are sharply pointed, and prominent
lower canines that resemble small tusks. Ore
youths on some worlds are told about their ancestors'
great travels and travails. Inspired by those
tales, many of those ores wonder when Gruumsh
will call on them to match the heroic deeds of old
and if they will prove worthy of his favor. Other
ores are happy to leave old tales in the past and find
their own way.

TIEFLING
Tieflings are either born in the Lower Planes or
have fiendish ancestors who originated there. A
tiefling (pronounced TEE-fling) is linked by blood
to a devil, a demon, or some other Fiend . This connection
to the Lower Planes is the tiefling's fiendish
legacy, which comes with the promise of power yet
has no effect on the tiefling's moral o utlook.
A tiefling chooses whether to embrace or lament
their fiendish legacy. The three legacies are de scribed
below.
ABYSSAL
The entropy of the Abyss, the chaos of Pandemonium,
and the despair of Carceri call to tieflings
who have the abyssal legacy. Horns, fur, tusks, and
peculiar scents are common physical features of
such tieflings, most of whom have the blood of demons
coursing through their veins.
CH T HONIC
Tieflings who have the chthonic legacy feel not only
the tug of Carceri but also the greed of Gehenna
and the gloom of Hades. Some o f these tieflings look
cadaverous. Others possess the unearthly beauty
of a succubus, or they have physical features in
common with a night hag, a yugoloth, or some other
Neutral Evil fiendi s h ancest or.
INFERNAL
The i nfernal lega cy connects ti eflings no t only to
Gehenna but also the Nine Hells a nd the raging
battlefields of Ach eron. Ho rns, s pioes, tails, golden
eyes , and a fa int odor of sul fur or sm oke are common
physical featu res of s uc h t iefl i, gs , most of

EQUIPMENT
HE RIGHT EQUIPMENT CAN MAKE THE
difference between success and failure for
adventurers. This chapter provides rules and
prices for weapons, armor, and other kinds of equipment
that characters might purchase or find. The
DM lets you know if a shop has an item for sale and
whether it's available at the listed price.
COINS
Characters often find coins on their adventures
and can spend those coins in shops, inns, and other
businesses. Coins come in different denominations
based on the relative worth of their material. The
Coin Values table lists coins and how much they're
worth relative to the Gold Piece, which is the game's
main coin. For example, 100 Copper Pieces are
worth 1 Gold Piece.
A coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty
coins weigh a pound.

The Weapons table in this section shows the game's
main weapons. The table lists the cost and weight of
each weapon, as well as the following details:
Category. Every weapon falls into a category: Simple
or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually
tied to one of these categories. For example, you
might have proficiency with Simple weapons.
Melee or Ranged. A weapon is classified as either
Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to
attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged
weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.
SELLINC EQUIPMENT
Equ ipment fetches half its cost when sold. In contras
t, trade goods and valuables-like gems and
art objec ts- retain their full value in the marketplace.
The Dungeon Master's Guide has prices for
magic items.
Damage. The table lists the amount of damage a
weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well
as the type of that damage.
Properties. Any properties a weapon has are listed
in the Properties column. Each property is defined
in the "Properties" section.
Mastery. Each weapon has a mastery property,
which is defined in the "Mastery Properties" section
later in this chapter. To use that property, you
must have a feature that lets you use it.
WEAPON PROFICIENCY
Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have
proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to
an attack roll you make with it. A player character's
features can provide weapon proficiencies. A monster
is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.
PROPERTIES
Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties
column of the Weapons table.
AMMUNITION
You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition
property to make a ranged attack only if you have
ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition
required is specified with the weapon's range. Each
attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing
the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a
free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a
fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the
ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the
rest is lost.
FINESSE
When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use
your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier
for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the
same modifier for both rolls.

way , such as using a Ranged weapon to make a
melee attack.
Light weapon, and you don't add your ability mod·
if1er to the extra attack's damage unless that modi·
fier is negative. For example, you can attack with a
Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other
using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you
don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the
damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modi fier
is negative.

Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus
Action, or a Reaction to fire it , regardless of the

lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal
range in feet, and the second is the weapon's long
range. When attacking a target beyond normal
range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll.
You can't attack a target beyond the long range.
REACH
A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you
attack with it, as well as when determining your
reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.
THROWN
If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can
throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and
you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If
the weapon is a Melee weapon , use the same ability

A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when
you attack with it.

The Armor table lists the game's main armor. The
table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well
as the following details:
Category. Every type of armor fa lls into a category:
Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines
how long it takes to don or doff the armor
(as shown in the table).
Armor Class {AC). The table's Armor Class column
tells you what your base AC is when you wear a
type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather
Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity
modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.
Strength. If the table shows a Strength score in the
Strength column for an a rmor type, that armor
reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the
wearer has a Streng th score equal to or higher
than the listed score.
Stealth. If the table shows "Disadvantage" in the
Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has
Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
ARMOR T RA-IN-IN-G- ---------
Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only
those with t raining can use them effectively, as explained
below. A character's class and other features
determine the cha racter's armor training. Amonster
has training· with any armor in its stat block.

If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and
lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any
D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and
you can't cast spells.
SHIELD
You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if
you have training with it.
ONE ATA TIME
A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a
time and wield only one Shield at a time.
VARIANT: EQUIPMENT SIZES
In most campaigns, you can use or wear any
equipment that you find on your adventures,
within the bounds of common sense. For example,
an ore adventurer won't fit in a halfling's
Leather Armor, and a cloud giant's robe would be
far too large for a gnome.
The OM can impose more realism. For example,
a suit of Plate Armor made for one human might
not fit another one without significant alterations,
and a guard's uniform might be visibly ill-fitting
when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise.
Using this variant, when adventurers find armor,
clothing, and similar items that are made to
be worn, they might need to visit a smith, a tailor,
a leatherworker, or a similar expert to make the
item wearable. The cost for such work is ld4 x 10
percent of the market price of the item.

LARGE VEHICLES
The Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table provides
statistics for various types of large vehicles.
The following notes apply.
SPEED
A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half
speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships
can't move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats
and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going
downstream, add the speed of the current (typically
3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle . These
vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current,
but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals
on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and
weighs 100 pounds.
CREW
A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs
a crew of skilled hirelings (see "Services" later in
this chapter) to function. The minimum number of
skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on
the type of ship, as shown in the table.
AIRBORNE AND WATERBORNE VEHICLES
PASSENGERS
The table lists the number of Small a n d Me dium
passengers the ship can accommodate u si ng hammocks.
A ship outfitted with private ac commodations
can carry one-fifth as many pa sse ngers. A
passenger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammo k
b . f C ' ut prices can vary rom ship to ship. A s ma ll private
cabin usually costs 2 GP pe r day.
DAMAGE THRESHOLD
If a vehicle has a damage threshold (see the rules
glossary), it's noted in the table.
SHIP REPAIR
Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the
vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage
requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and labor.
If the repairs are made in a location where supplies
and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city
shipyard , the repair time and cost are halved .
SERVICES
This section outlines serv ices and other expenses
that adventurers might spend money on.
LIFESTYLE EXPENSES
Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a
fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment
maintenance, and other necessities.

choose a lifestyle below-Wretched, Squalid, Poor,
Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic-and
pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.
Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the
DM might take them into account when determining
risks or how others perceive your character.

MAGIC ITEMS
Adventures hold the promise-but not a guaranteeof
finding magic items. Hundreds of magic items are
detailed in the Dungeon Master's Guide, since the DM
decides when you find such an item. Here's what
you need to know about using magic items.
IDENTIFYING A M AGIC ITEM
Some magic items are indistinguishable from their
nonmagical counterparts, while others are conspicuously
magical. Handling a magic item is enough to
give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learning
a magic item's properties isn't automatic.
The Identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an
item's properties. Alternatively, you can focus on
one magic item during a Short Rest while being in
232 CHAPT ER 6 I EQUI PMENT
physical contact with the item. At the encl of the
rest, you learn its properties and how to use them
(but not any curse the item might bear).
Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties.
The command word to activate a ring might
be etched inside the band, or a feathered design
might hint that it's a Ring of Feath er· Falling.
Wearing or experimenting with an item can also
offer hints about its properties. In the specific case
of Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster
what a potion does. Other items might require
more experimentation. For example, if your character
puts on a Ring of Swimming, the OM might say,
"Your movement feels strangely fluid." Perhaps you
then dive into a river to see what happens. The OM
would then say you swim unexpectedly well.
ATTUNEMENT
Some magic items require a creature to form a
bond-called Attunement- with them before the
creature can use an item's magical properties.
Without becoming attuned to an item that requires
Attunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits
unless its description states otherwise. For example,
a magic Shield that requires Attunement provides
the benefits of a normal Shield if you aren't attuned
to it, but none of its magical properties.
ATTUNE DURING A SHORT REST
Attuning to an item requires you to spend a Short
Rest focused on only that item while being in physical
contact with it (this can't be the same Short Rest
used to learn the item's properties). This focus can
take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon),
meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate
activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the
Attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of
the Short Rest, you're attuned to the magic item and
can access its full magical capabilities.
No MORE THAN THREE ITEMS
You can be attuned to no more than three magic
items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth
item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item
first. Additionally, you can't attune to more than
one copy of an item. For example, you can't attune
to more than one Ring of Protection at a time.
ENDINGATTUNEMENT
Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer
satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item
has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24
hours, if you die, or if another cr eature attunes to
the item. You can also voluntarily en<l Attunement
by spending another Short Rest focused on the item
unless the item is cursed.
WEARIN C: A~D ~Vr r~LDING ITEMS
Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing
or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must
be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on feet,
gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head, and
rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned, a
Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about
the shoulders. A weapon must be held.
In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be
worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build.
Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or
they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.
MULTIPLE ITEMS OF THE SAME KIND
You can't wear more than one of certain magic
items. You can't normally wear more than one pair
of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair
of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear,
or one cloak. The OM might make exceptions.
PAIRED ITEMS
Items that come in pairs- such as boots, bracers,
gauntlets, and gloves-impart their benefits only
if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a
character wearing a Boot of Striding and Springing
on one foot and a Boot of Elvenkind on the other foot
gains no benefit from either.
CRAFTING EQUIPMENT
Using the rules below, characters can make nonmagical
items, Potions of Healing, and Spell Scrolls.
CRAFTING NONMAGICAL ITEMS
To craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw materials,
and time, each of which is detailed below. If
you meet the requirements, you make the item, and
you can use it or sell it at its normal price.
T OOLS
This chapter's "Tools" section lists which tools are
required to make certain items. The OM assigns required
tools for items not listed there.
You must use the required tool to make an item
and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who
helps you must also have proficiency with it.
RAW MATERIALS
To make an item, you need raw materials worth
half its purchase cost (round down). For example,
you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate Armor,
which sells for 1,500 GP. The OM determines
whether appropriate raw materials are available.
TIME
To determine how many days (working 8 hours a
day) it takes to make an item, divide its purchase
cost in GP by 10 (round a fraction up to a day). For
example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Crossbow,
which sells for SO GP.
If an item requires multiple days, the days needn't
be consecutive.
Characters can combine their efforts to shorten
the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create
an item by the number of characters working on it.
Normally, only one other character can assist you,
but the DM might allow more assistants.
BREWING POTIONS OF HEALING
A character who has proficiency with the Herbalism
Kit can create a Potion of Healing. Doing so requires
using that kit and 25 GP of raw material over the
course of 1 day (8 hours of work).
SCRIBING SPELL SCROLLS
A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and create
a Spell Scroll, using the rules below.
TIME AND COST
Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and
money based on the level of the spell, as shown in
the Spell Scroll Costs table. For each day of inscription,
you must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires
multiple days, those days needn't be consecutive.
PREREQUISITES FOR THE SCRIBE
To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the
Arcana skill or with Calligrapher's Tools and have
the spell prepared on each day of the inscription.
You must also have at hand any Material components
required by the spell; if the spell consumes
its Material components, they are consumed only
when you complete the scroll. The scroll's spell uses
your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.
CANTRIPS
If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the
scroll works as if the caster were your level.

spell s. It also includes descriptions of common
spel ls in the worlds of DUNGEONS
& DRAGONS. Those spells are used by many class
features, magic items, and monsters.
GAINING SPELLS
Before you can cas t a spell, you must have the spell
prepared in your mind or have access to the spell
from a magic item, such as a Spell Scroll. Your features
specify which spells you have access to, if any;
whether you always have certain spells prepared;
and whether you can change the list of spells you
have prepared.
PREPARING SPELLS
If you have a list of level 1 + spells you prepare, your
spellcasting feature specifies when you can change
the list and the number of spells you can change, as
summarized in the Spell Preparation by Class table.
SPELL PREPARATION BY CLASS
Class Change When You ... Number of Spells
Bard Gain a level One
Cleric Finish a Long Rest Any
Druid Finish a Long Rest Any
Paladin Finish a Long Rest One
Ranger Finish a Long Rest One
Sorcerer Gain a level One
Warlock Gain a level One
Wizard Finish a Long Rest Any
Most spellcasting monsters don't change their lists
of prepared spells, but the OM is free to alter them.
ALWAYS-PREPARED SPELLS
Certain featu res might give you a spell that you
always have prepared. If you also have a list of prepared
spells t hat you can change, a spell that you
always have prepared doesn't count against the
number of spells on that list.

---- -·-- •• ---- -------------
C ASTING SPELLS
Each spell description has a series of entries that
provide the details needed to cast the spell. The following
sections explain each of those entries, which
follow a spell's name.
SPELL LEVEL
Every spell has a level from O to 9, which is indicated
in a spell's description. A spell's level is an
indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips-simple
spells that can be cast almost by rote-are level 0.
The rules for each spellcasting class say when its
members gain access to spells of certain levels.
SPELL SLOTS
Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only
a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting.
Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster's magical
potential is represented. Each spellcasting class
gives its members a limited number of spell slots of
certain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wizard
has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots.
When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that
spell's level or higher, effectively "filling" a slot
with the spell. Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a
certain size-small for a level 1 slot and larger for a
higher-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any
size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that's at
least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts Magic
Missile, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of
four level 1 slots and has three remaining.
Finishing a Long Rest restores any expended spell
slots.
C AST ING WITHOUT SLOTS
There are several ways to cast a spell without
expending a spell slot:
Cantrips. A cantrip is cast without a spell slot.
Rituals. Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the
Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast following
the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can
be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell
takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it
doesn't expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Ritual,
a spellcaster must have it prepared.
Special Abilities. Some characters and monsters
have special abilities that allow them to cast specific
spells without a spell slot. This casting is usually
limited in another way, such as being able to
cast the spell a limited number of times per day.
CHAPTER 7 I PELLS 235
Magic Items. Spell Scrolls and some other magic
items contain spells that can be cast without a
spell slot. The description of such an item specifies
how many times a spell can be cast from it.
USING A HIGHER-LEVEL SPELL SLOT
When a spelkaster casts a spell using a slot that is
of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on
the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a
Wizard casts Magic Missile using a level 2 slot, that
Magic Missile is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands
to fill the slot it is put into.
Some spells, such as Magic Missile and Cure
Wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a
higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.
S CHO OL OF MAGIC
Each spell belongs to a school of magic. The schools
are listed in the Schools of Magic table. These categories
help describe spells but have no rules of their
own, although some other rules refer to them.
SCHOOLS OF MAGIC
School Typical Effects
Abjuration Prevents or reverses harmful effects
Conjuration Transports creatures or objects
Divination Reveals information
Enchantment Influences minds
Evocation Channels energy to create effects
that are often destructive
Illusion Deceives the mind or senses
Necromancy Manipulates life and death
Transmutation Transforms creatures or objects
CLASS SPELL LISTS
If a spell is on a cla ss's spell list , t he class's na me
appears in parentheses after the spell's s chool of
magic . Some features ad d a spell to a character's
spell lis t even if the char ac ter isn't a member of a
cl a ss in the parentheses.
CASTING TIME
Most spells require the Magic action to cast, but
some spells require a Bonus Action, a Reaction, or 1
minute or more. Aspell's Casting Time entry specifies
which of those is required.
ONE SPELL WITH A SPELL SLOT PER TURN
On a turn, you can expend only one spell slot to cast
a spell. This rule means you can't, for example, cast
a spell with a spell slot using the Magic action and
another one using a Bonus Action on the same turn.
236 CH APTER 7 I S P E L L S
REACTION AND BONUS A C T ION ' J>.(, G ERS
A spell that has a casting time of a R eacti o n is cast
in response to a trigger that is define d in th e spell's
Casting Time entry. Some spells that h ave a casting
time of a Bonus Action are also cast in r es ponse to a
trigger defined in the spell.
LONGER CASTING TIMES
Certain spells-including a spell cast as a Ritualrequire
more time to cast: minutes or even hours.
While you cast a spell with a casting time of 1
minute or more, you must take the Magic action
on each of your turns, and you must maintain Concentration
(see the rules glossary) while you do so.
If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but
you don't expend a spell slot. To cast the spell again,
you must start over.
R A NGE
Aspell's range indicates how far from the spellcaster
the spell's effect can originate, and the spell's
description specifies which part of the effect is limited
by the range.
A range usually takes one of the following forms:
Distance. The range is expressed in feet.
Touch. The spell's effect originates on something
the spellcast er must touch, as defined in the spell.
Self. The spell is cast on the spellcaster or emanates
from them, as specified in the spell.
If a spell has movable effects, they aren't restricted
by its range unless the spell's description says
otherwise.
COMP O NENTS
Aspell's c omponen ts are phy sic al r equir ements the
s pel lcas te r must m eet to cast the spell. Each spell's
desc r iption i nd ic ates w hether it r e q uires Verbal
(V), Somat ic (S ), or Materia l (M) comp onents. If
t he spellcaster can't provide one or more of a spell's
co mponents, the spellca ster can't cas t the spe ll.
VERBAL (V)
A Verbal c o mponent is t h e chanting of esot er ic
words that sound like nonsense to the uni n iti a t e d.
The words must be uttered in a normal speakin g
voice. The words themselves aren't the source o f the
spell's power; rather, the particular combinat io n o f
sounds, with specific pitch a nd resonance, sets the
threads of magic in motion. Thu s, a c r eature who is
gagged or in an area of magi cal si l ence can't cast a
spell with a Verbal componen t.
SOMATIC (S)
A Somatic component is a force fu l g e sticulation
or an intricate set of gestures. A sp cllcas ter must
use at least one of their h a nd s !.( 1 :; ~r fnr m these
movements.
A Material component is a particular material
used in a spell's casting, as specified in parentheses
in the Components entry. These materials aren't
consumed by the spell unless the spell's description
states otherwise. The spellcaster must have a hand
free to access them , but it can be the same hand
used to perform Somatic components , if any.
If a spell doesn't consume its materials and doesn't
specify a cost for them, a spellcaster can use a Component
Pouch (see chapter 6) instead of providing
the materials specified in the spell, or the spellcaster
can substitute a Spellcasting Focus if the caster
has a featu re that allows that substitution. To use
a Component Pouch, you must have a hand free to
reach into it, and to use a Spellcasting Focus, you
must hold it unless its description says otherwise
(see chapter 6 for descriptions).
CREATING VERBAL COMPONENTS
If you 'd like to say a spell 's Verbal component,
you may m ake up the wo rds . However you make
them, the goa l is to create someth ing t hat 's easy
to say and t hat doesn 't mean anything in the rea l
wo rl d. Co nside r th is met hod: take the name of
th e spel l, keep o nly one instance of each of its
lette rs, and rear ran ge t he remaining letters into
words. For exa mple , remove the second I from
Fire ball and rea rra nge the remaining letters to
create Ber Fi fCi o r Fe / Bi ra.
A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists
after it is cast. A duration typically takes one of
the following forms:
Concentration. A duration that requires Concentration
follows the Concentration rules (see the
rules glossary).
Instantaneous. An instantaneous duration means
the spell's magic appears only for a moment and
then disappears.
Time Span. A duration that provides a time span
specifies how long the spell lasts in rounds, minutes,
hours , or the like . For example, a Duration
entry might say "1 minute," meaning the spell ends
after 1 minute has passed. While a time-span spell
that you cast is ongoing, you can dismiss it (no action
required) if you don't have the Incapacitated
condition.
EFFECTS
The effects of a spell are detailed after its duration
entry. Those details present exactly what the spell
does, which ignores mundane physical laws; any
outcomes beyond those effects are under the DM's
purview. Whatever the effects, they typically deal
with targets, saving throws, attack rolls, or all
three, each of which is detailed below.
T ARG ETS
A typical spell requires the caster to pick one or
more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A
spelJ's description says whether the spell targets
creatures, objects, or something else.
CHAPT ER 7 I SPELLS 2 37
A Clear Path to the Target. To target something
with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it , so
it can't be behind Total Cover.
Targeting Yourself. If a spell targets a creature
of your choice, you can choose yourself unless the
creature must be Hostile or specifically a creature
other than you.
Areas of Effect. Some spells , such as Thunderwave,
cover an area called an area of effect, which is defined
in the rules glossary. The area determines
what the spell targets. The description of a spell
specifies whether it has an area of effect, which is
typically one of these shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder,
Emanation, Line, or Sphere.
Awareness of Being Targeted. Unless a spell has a
perceptible effect, a creature doesn't know it was
targeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is obvious,
but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt
to read thoughts, goes unnoticed unless a spell's
description says otherwise.
Invalid Targets. If you cast a spell on someone
or something that can't be affected by it, nothing
happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to
cast the spell, the slot is still expended.
If the spell normally has no effect on a target that
succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears
to have succeeded on its saving throw, even
though it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the
creature is an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive
that the spell did nothing to the target.
SAVING THROWS
Many spells specify that a target makes a saving
throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The
spell specifies the ability that the target uses for
238 CHAPTER 7 I SPE LLS
the save and what happens on a success or failure.
Here's how to calculate the DC for your spells:
Spell save DC= 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier
+ your Proficiency Bonus
ATTACK ROLLS
Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll
to determine whether the spell hits a target . Here's
how to calculate the attack modifier for your spells:
Spell attack modifier= your spellcasting ability
modifier+ your Proficiency Bonus
COMBINING SPELL EFFECTS
The effects of different spells add together while
their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of
the same spell cast multiple times don't combine.
Instead, the most potent effect-such as the highest
bonus-from those castings applies while their
durations overlap. The most recent effect applies if
the castings are equally potent and their durations
overlap. For example, if two Clerics cast Bless on the
same target, that target gains the spell's benefit only
once; the target doesn't receive two bonus dice. But
if the durations of the spell s overlap, the effect continues
until the duration of the s econd Bless ends.

while in that form.
The target gains a number of Temporary Hit
Points equal to the Beast form's Hit Points. The
transformation lasts for the duration for each target,

Small Humanoid within range . The target becomes
an Undead creature: a Skeleton if you chose bones
or a Zombie if you chose a corpse (see appendix B
for the stat blocks).
On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus
Action to mentally command any creature you
made with this spell if the creature is within 60
feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you
can command any of them at the same time, issuing
the same command to each one). You decide
what action the creature will take and where it will
move on its next turn, or you can issue a general
command, such as to guard a chamber or corridor.
If you issue no commands, the creature takes the
Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. Once
given an order, the creature continues to follow it
until its task is complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
after which it stops obeying any command you've
given it. To maintain control of the creature for another
24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature
again before the current 24-hour period ends.
This use of the spell reasserts your control over up
to four creatures you have animated with this spell
rather than animating a new creature.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. You animate or
reassert control over two additional Undead creatures
for each spell slot level above 3. Each of the

ANTIPATHY/SYMPATHY
Level 8 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Wizard)
Casting Time: l hour
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a mix of vinegar and honey)
Duration: 10 days
As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates antipathy
or sympathy, and target one creature or object
that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of
creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.
A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom
saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the
target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy determines
what happens to a creature when it fails that
save:
Antipathy. The creature has the Frightened condition.
The Frightened creature must use its movement
on its turns to get as far away as possible
from the target, moving by the safest route.
Sympathy. The creature has the Charmed condition.
The Charmed creature must use its move ment
on its turns to get as close as possible to the
target, moving by the safest route. If the creature
is within 5 feet of the target, the creature can't
willingly move away. If the target damages the
Charmed creature, that creature can make a Wisdom
saving throw to end the effect, as described
below.
Ending the Effect. If the Frightened or Charmed
creature ends its turn more than 120 feet away
from the target, the creature makes a Wisdom saving
throw. On a successful save , the creature is no
longer affected by the target. A creature that successfully
saves against this effect is immune to it for
1 minute, after which it can be affected again.

Duration: Until dispelled
You and up to eight willing creatures within range
project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the
spell ends instantly if you are already on that plane).
Each target's body is left behind in a state of suspended
animation; it has the Unconscious condition,
doesn't need food or air, and doesn't age.
A target's astral form resembles its body in almost
every way, replicating its game statistics and possessions.
The principal difference is the addition of
a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder
blades of the astral form. The cord fades from view
after 1 foot. If the cord is cut-which happens only
when an effect states that it does so-the target's
body and astral form both die.
CH PTER 7 I SPELLS ~43
A target's astral form can travel through the Astral
Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that
plane, the target's body and possessions travel along
the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter its
body on the new plane.
Any damage or other effects that apply to an astral
form have no effect on the target's body and
vice versa. If a target's body or astral form drops to
0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that target. The spell
ends for all the targets if you take a Magic action to
dismiss it.
When the spell ends for a target who isn't dead ,
the target reappears in its body and exits the state
of suspended animation .

Casting Time: l hour
Range:Touch

Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
You inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical
effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a
table or a section of floor) or within an object that
can be closed (such as a book or chest) to conceal
the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger
CHA PTER 7 I SPELLS '2'70
than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is
moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this
spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without
being triggered.
The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a
successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your
spell save DC to notice.
When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger
and choose whether it's an explosive rune or a spell
glyph, as explained below.
Set the 1Hgger. You decide what triggers the glyph
when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a
surface, common triggers include touching or stepping
on the glyph, removing another object covering
it, or approaching within a certain distance of it.
For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers
include opening that object or seeing the glyph.
Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
You can refine the trigger so that only creatures
of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph
could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set
conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph,
such as those who say a certain password.
Explosive Rune. When triggered, the glyph erupts
with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere
centered on the glyph. Each creature in the area
makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes
Sd8 Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage
(your choice when you create the glyph) on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of
level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of
creating the glyph. The spell must target a single
creature or an area. The spell being stored has no
immediate effect when cast in this way.
When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell takes
effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature
t hat triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an
a rea, the a r ea is center ed on t hat creat ure. If the
s p e ll summons Hostile creat ures or creates harmful
objects or t r aps, they appear as close as possible to
the int r uder a nd attack it . If the spell requires Concent
ration , it lasts until the end of it s full duration.
Using a Highe r-Level Spell Slot. T h e d amage of an

When that trigger occurs, a magical mouth appears
on the object and recites the message in your
voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object
you chose has a mouth or something that looks
like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue),
the magical mouth appears there, so the words appear
to come from the object's mouth. When you
cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it
delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its
message whenever the trigger occurs.
The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you
like, though it must be based on visual or audible
conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object.
For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak
when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object
or when a .s ilver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

MAJOR IMAGE
Level 3 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or
some other visible phenomenon that is no larger
than a 20-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot
that you can see within range and lasts for the duration.
It seems real, including sounds, smells, and
temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but
it can't deal damage or cause conditions.
If you are within range of the illusion, you can
take a Magic action to cause the image to move to
any other spot within range. As the image changes
location, you can alter its appearance so that its
movements appear natural for the image. For example,
if you create an image of a creature and move
it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be
walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to
make different sounds at different times, even making
it carry on a conversation, for example.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to
be an illusion, for things can pass through it. A creature
that takes a Study action to examine the image
can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for
what it is, the creature can see through the image,
and its other sensory qualities become faint to the
creature.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The spell lasts until
dispelled, without requiring Concentration, if cast
with a level 4+ spell slot.

look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other

rough or impassable te r rain. A pond can be made to
seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle
slope, or a rock- strewn gully like a wide and smooth
road.
Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures
or add them where none are present. The spell
doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
The illus ion includes audible, visual, tactile, and
olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into
Difficult Terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede
movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory
terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed
from the spell's area disappears immediately.
Cr eatures with Truesight can see through the illusion
to the terrain's true form ; however, all other eleme
nts of the illusion remain, so while the creature
is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can
still physically interact with the illusion.

that an illusory double of you appears where you

the invisibility ends immediately after you make an
attack roll , deal damage , or cast a spell.

double up to twice your Speed and make it gesture,

MODI FY MEMORY
Level 5 Enchantment (Bard , Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to l minute
You attempt to reshape another creature's memories.
One creature that you can see within range
makes a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting
the creature, it has Advantage on the save. On a
failed save, the target has the Charmed condition
for the duration. While Charmed in this way, the
target also has the Incapacitated condition and is
unaware of its surroundings, though it can hear
CHAPTER 7 I SPELLS 299
you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another
spell, this spell ends, and no memories are modified.
While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's
memory of an event that it experienced within the
last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes.
You can permanently eliminate all memory of
the event, allow the target to recall the event with
perfect clarity, change its memory of the event's de tails,
or create a memory of some other event.
You must speak to the target to describe how its
memories are affected, and it must be able to understand
your language for the modified memories to
take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of
your description. If the spell ends before you finish
describing the modified memories, the creature's
memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories
take hold when the spell ends.
A modified memory doesn 't necessarily affect
how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory
contradicts the creature's natural inclinations,
alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory,
such as a false memory of how much the creature
enjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad
dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too
nonsensical to affect a creature.
A Remove Curse or Greater Restoration spell cast on
the target restores the creature's true memory.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. You can alter the
target's memories of an event that took place up to 7
days ago (level 6 spell slot), 30 days ago (level 7 spell
slot), 365 days ago (level 8 spell slot), or any time in
the creature's past (level 9 spell slot).

fills the Cylinder, and you can take a Magic action
on later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.
When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it
makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if
the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the Polymorph
spell, for example), it reverts to its true form
and can't shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder.
On a successful save, a creature takes half as much
damage only. A creature also makes this save when
the spell's area moves into its space and when it

all who enter. You determine the appearance of
these servants and their attire. They are invulnerable
and obey your commands. Each servant can
perform tasks that a human could perform, but they
can't attack or take any action that would directly
harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch
things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve
food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can't leave
the dwelling.
When the spell ends, any creatures or objects left
inside the extradimensional space are expelled into

Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on
a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand , or
clay in the area in any manner you choose for the
duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation,
create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall,
or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes
can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. For
example, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can
create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the
square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up
to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for
these changes to complete. Because the terrain's
transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area
can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's
movement.
At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating
on the spell, you can choose a new area of
terrain to affect within range.
This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone
construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate
the new terrain. If the way you shape the
terrain would make a structure unstable, it might
collapse.

growth. The moved earth carries any plants along

Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to l minute
You attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of
a creature you can see within range. The target
makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed
save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or
other phenomenon that is no larger than a 10-foot
Cube and that is perceivable only to the target for
the duration. The phantasm includes sound, temperature,
and other stimuli.
The target can take a Study action to examine the
phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check
against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds,
the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion,
and the spell ends.
While affected by the spell, the target treats the
phantasm as if it were real and rationalizes any illogical
outcomes from interacting with it. For example,
if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge
and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists
and something else caused it to fall.
An affected target can even take damage from
the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous
creature or hazard. On each of your turns, such a
phantasm can deal 2d8 Psychic damage to the target
if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of
the phantasm. The target perceives the damage as a
type appropriate to the illusion.

PLANAR ALLY
Level 6 Conjuration (Cleric)
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantan eous
You beseech an otherworldl.' entity for aid. The
being must be known toy ,~1: a god, a demon prince,
or some other being of cosmir f0~.-,cr. That entity
sends a Cele stia l, an Elemental, or a Fiend loyal to
it to aid you. making the creature appear in an unoccupied
space within r ange. If you know a specific
creature's name, you can speak that name when
you cast this spell to request that creature, though
you might get a different creature anyway (DM's
choice).
When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion
to behave a particular way. You can ask it
to perform a service in exchange for payment, but
it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could
range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help
us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or
protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You
must be able to communicate with the creature to
bargain for its services.
Payment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial
might require a sizable donation of gold or magic
items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand
a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some
creatures might exchange their service for a quest
undertaken by you.
A task that can be measured in minutes requires
a payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured
in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And
a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires
10,000 GP per day. The OM can adjust these payments
based on the circumstances under which you
cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's
ethos, the payment might be halved or even
waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only
half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous
tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures
rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.
After the creature completes the task, or when the
agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature
returns to its home plane after reporting back
to you if possible. If you are unable to agree on a
price for the creature's service, the creature immediately
returns to its home plane.

be within range for the entire casting of the spell.
(Typically, the creature is first summoned into
the center of the inverted version of the Magic
Circle spell to ·ap it while this spell is cast.) At the
completion of the casting, the target must succeed
on a Charisma saving throw or be bound to serve
you for the duration. If the creature was summoned
or created by another spell, that spell's duration is
extended to match the duration of this spell.
A bound creature must follow your commands
to the best of its ability. You might command the
creature to accompany you on an adventure to
guard a location, or to deliver a message. If the
creature is Hostile, it strives to twist your commands
to achieve its own objectives. If the creature
carries out your commands completely before the
spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you
a:e on the same plane of existence. If you are on a
d1ffere~t plane, it returns to the place where you
bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (jade dust worth 25+ GP)
Duration: Until dispelled
--
You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or
some other visible phenomenon within range that
activates when a specific trigger occurs. The illusion
is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than
a 30-foot Cube, and you decide when you cast the
spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it
makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5
minutes.
When the trigger you specify occurs, the illusion
springs into existence and performs in the manner
you described. Once the illusion finishes performing,
it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes,
after which the illusion can be activated again.
The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you
like, though it must be based on visual or audible
phenomena that occur within 30 feet of the area.
For example, you could create an illusion of yourself
to appear and warn off others who attempt to open
a trapped door.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be
illusory, since things can pass through it. A creature
that takes the Study action to examine the image
can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell
save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what
it is, the creature can see through the image, and
any noise it: makes sounds hollow to the creature.

You can see through the illusion's eyes and hear
through its ears as if you were in its space. As a
Magic action, you can move it up to 60 feet and
make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way
you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
You inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface
(such as a section of floor or wall) or within an
object that can be closed (such as a book or chest).
The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet
in diameter. If you choose an object, it must remain
in place; if it is moved more than 10 feet from where
you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell
ends without being triggered.
The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a
successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your
spell save DC to notice.
When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger
and choose which effect the symbol bears: Death,
Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning. Each one is
explained below.
Set the Trigger. You decide what triggers the glyph
when you cast the spell . For glyphs inscribed on a
surface, common triggers include touching or stepping
on the glyph, removing another object covering
it, or approaching within a certain distance of it.
For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers
include opening that object or seeing the glyph.
You can refine the trigger so that only creatures
of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph
could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set
conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph,
such as those who say a certain password.
Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a
60-foot-radius Sphere with Dim Light for 10 minutes,
after which time the spell ends. Each creature
in the Sphere when the glyph activates is targeted
by its effect, as is a creature that enters the Sphere
for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A
creature is targeted only once per turn.
Death. Each target makes a Constitution saving
throw, taking l0dl0 Necrotic damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful save.

at least 30 feet aw ay from the glyph on each of its
turns, if able.

H PTER 7 I SPELLS
Familiarity. Here are the meanings of the terms in
the table's Familiarity column:
"Permanent circle" means a permanent teleportation
circle whose sigil sequence you know.
"Linked object" means you possess an object
taken from the desired destination within the last
six months, such as a book from a wizard's library.
"Very familiar" is a place you have visited often,
a place you have carefully studied, or a place you
can see when you cast the spell.
"Seen casually" is a place you have seen more than
once but with which you aren't very familiar.
• "Viewed once or described" is a place you have
seen once, possibly using magic, or a place you
know through someone else's description, perhaps
from a map.
• "False destination" is a place that doesn' t exist.
Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but
instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting
to teleport to a location that no longer exists.
Mishap. The spell's unpredictable magic results in
a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the
target object) takes 3d10 Force damage, and the DM
rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple
mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).
Similar Area. You and your group (or the target
object) appear in a different area that's visually or
thematically similar to the target area. You appear
in the closest similar place. If you are heading for
your home laboratory, for example, you might appear
in another person's laboratory in the same city.
Off Target. You and your group (or the target object)
appear 2d12 miles away from the destination
in a random direction. Roll ld8 for the direction: 1,
east; 2, southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5, west; 6,
northwest; 7, north; or 8, northeast.
On Target. You and your group (or the target object)
appear where you intended.

portal opens within the circle you d r ew a nd
remains open until the end o f your n ext tu rn. A ny
creature that enters the porta l i n stantly appears
within 5 feet of the destinat ion ci r cle o r in the nea r est
unoccupied space if that space is occupie d.

be su rro u u d ed on a ll sid es by the w all (or the wall
and an o tn~· r s o lid surface), that c r eature can make
a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use
its Reaction to move up to its Speed so that it is no
longer enclosed by the wall.
T?e wall can have any shape you desire, though it
cant occupy the same space as a creature or object.
The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on a firm
foundation. It must, however, merge with and be
solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can
use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.
If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length,
you must halve the size of each panel to create supports.
You can crudely shape the wall to create battlements
and the like.
The wall is an object made of stone that can be
damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15
and 30 Hit Points per inch of thickness, and it has
Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. Reducing
a panel to O Hit Points destroys it and might cause
connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.
If you maintain your Concentration on this spell

WISH
Level 9 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply
speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.
The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other
spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you
don't need to meet any requirements to cast that
spell, including costly components. The spell simply
takes effect.
Alternatively, you can create one of the following
effects of your choice:
Object Creation. You create one object of up to
25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The
object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension,
and it appears in an unoccupied space
that you can see on the ground.
Instant Health. You allow yourself and up to
twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit
Points, and you end all effects on them listed in
the Greater Restoration spell.
Resistance. You grant up to ten creatures that you
can see Resistance to one damage type that you
choose. This Resistance is permanent.
Spell Immunity. You grant up to ten creatures you
can see immunity to a single spell or other magical
effect for 8 hours.
Sudden Learning. You replace one of your feats
with another feat for which you are eligible. You
lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the
benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat
that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or
features.
Cr!APTER 7 I SP ELt.S '2 '1.T
Roll Redo. You undo a single recent event by forcing
a reroll of any die roll made within the last
round {including your last turn). Reality reshapes
itself to accommodate the new result. For example
, a Wish spell could undo an ally's failed saving
throw or a foe's Critical Hit. You can force the re roll
to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage ,
and you choose whether to use the reroll or the
original roll.
Reshape Reality. You may wish for something not
included in any of the other effects . To do so, state
your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The
DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in
such an instance; the greater the wish , the greater
the likelihood that something goes wrong. This
spell might simply fail , the effect you desire might
be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an
unforeseen consequence as a result of how you
worded the wish. For example, wishing that a
villain were dead might propel you forward in
time to a period when that villain is no longer
alive, effectively removing you from the game.
Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or
an Artifact might instantly transport you to the
CHAPTER 7 I SPELLS
presence of the item's current owner. If your wish
is granted and its effects have consequences for a
whole community, region, or world, you are likely
to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect
a god, the god's divine servants might instantly intervene
to prevent it or to encourage you to craft
the wish in a particular way. If your wish would
undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of
Sigil , or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you
see an image of her in your mind for a moment;
she shakes her head, and your wish fails.
The stress of casting Wish to produce any effect
other than duplicating another spell weakens you.
After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell
until you finish a Long Rest, you take ldlO Necrotic
damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be
reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your
Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of
those days that you spend r estin g and doing nothing
more than light activity, you r r emaining recovery
time decreases by 2 days. Fin a ll y, t h ere is a 33 percent
chance that you are u n able to cas t Wish ever
again if you suffer this s tre ss.

normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be
evasive yet must be truthful.

APPENDIX A
THE MULTIVERSE
---·-"--CY-·
This appendix provides an overview of the multiverse,
the overarching reality that encompasses
D&D's countless worlds and adventures. These
realms are explored in greater detail in the Dungeon
Master's Guide, along with other planes like the Far
Realm, Negative Plane, and Positive Plane.
THE MATERIAL REALMS
The philosophical and elemental forces of reality
converge to create the following planes of existence:
Material Plane. Most D&D adventures take place
on the Material Plane, which holds the worlds of
settings like Dragonlance, Eberron, the Forgotten
Realms, and Greyhawk. There's also room for any
world your group creates. Magic and physical
laws shape this plane's diverse worlds.
Feywild. This vibrant, idealized realm brims with
life and emotion, which are most intense in the
realm's Domains of Delight.
Shadowfell. This gloom-haunted realm holds grim
wastelands, haunted ruins, and the infamous Domains
of Dread.
TRANSITIVE PLANES
The transitive planes serve as paths between planes:
Astral Plane. This endless, silvery expanse links the
Material Plane and the Outer Planes. Whole civilizations
have arisen in this glimmering vastness,
while others navigate the magical cosmos in spelljamming
vessels.
Ethereal Plane. This ghostly realm connects the
Material Plane and the Inner Planes. The region
where the Ethereal Plane overlaps with other
planes is called the Border Ethereal, a place where
creatures can glimpse visions of planes beyond.
THE INNER PLANES
Elemental forces and the building blocks of reality
originate from these Inner Planes:
Elemental Plane of Air. Winds blow clouds and
floating islands across this boundless sky.
Elemental Plane of Earth. This maze of caverns
winds through stone and untold mineral riches.
Elemental Plane of Fire. An everlasting inferno,
this realm blazes with life on volcanic islands.
Elemental Plane of Water. This bottomless ocean

Elemental Chaos. Here on the fringes of the Inner
Planes, elemental forces clash unpredictably.
Para-Elemental Planes. In these borderlands between
the Elemental Pl anes, elemental forces
combine into realms of ash, ice, magma, and ooze.
THE OUTER PLANES
Realms where ideas take form and spirits spend
their afterlives, the Outer Planes are the homes of
immortals. The following locations compose the
Outer Planes:
Sigil. Sigil, the City of Doors, is a metropolis rather
than a plane at the center of the Outer Planes.
Here portals lead throughout the multiverse, and
the enigmatic Lady of Pain maintains order.
Outlands. Influences from the other Outer Planes
converge in the Outlands, where portals lead to
those planes. At the Outlands' center rises the
Spire, a pillar atop which floats Sigil.
Other Outer Planes. These planes are listed on the
Outer Planes table. Some are paradises, some are
nightmare realms, and some are more bizarre.
Each is dominated by forces that embody one or
more of the alignments described in chapter 2.

RULES GLOSSARY
-==s:c::v=
GLOSSARY CONVENTIONS
The glossary uses the following conventions:
Tags in Brackets. Some entries have a tag in brackets
after the entry's name, as in "Attack [Action]."
A tag-Action, Area of Effect, Attitude, Condition,
or Hazard-indicates that a rule is part of a family
of rules. The tags also have glossary entries.
"You." The game's rules-in this glossary and elsewhere-
often talk about something happening to
you in the game world. That "you" refers to the
creature or object that the rule applies to in a particular
moment of play. For example, the "you" in
the Prone condition is a creature that currently
has that condition.
"See Also." Some glossary entries include a See also
section that points to other entries in the glossary,
to chapters in this book, or both.
No Obsolete Terms. The glossary contains definitions
of current rules terms only. If you're looking
for a term from an earlier version of the fifth edition
rules, consult the index.

APPEND C RULES GLOSSARY
RULES DEFINITIONS
Here are definitions of various rules.
ABILITY CHECK
An ability check is a D20 Test that represents using
one of the six abilities- or a specific skill associated
with an ability- to overcome a challenge. See also
chapter 1 ("D20 Tests" and "Proficiency").
ABILITY SCORE AND MODIFIER
A creature has six ability scores-Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma-
each of which has a corresponding modifier.
Add the modifier when you make a D20 Test with
the corresponding ability or when a rule asks you to
do so. See also chapter 1 ("The Six Abilities").
ACTION
On your turn, you can take one action. Choose
which action to take from those below or from the
special actions provided by your features. See also
chapter 1 ("Actions"). These actions are defined elsewhere
in this glossary:
Attack Dodge Influence Search
Dash Help Magic Study
Disengage Hide Ready Utilize
i:.- -- - - ~=-
ADVANTAGE
If you have Advantage on a D20 Test, roll two d20s,
and use the higher roll. A roll can't be affected by
more than one Advantage, and Advantage and Disadvantage
on the same roll cancel each other. See
also chapter 1 ("D20 Tests").
A DVENTUR E
An adventure is a s e ries of encounters. A story
eme r ges through playing them . See a lso "Encounter."
A LIGNMENT
A creature's alignment b r o a d ly descr ibes its ethical
attit udes and ideals . Alignmen t is a c ombination of
two factors : one identifies morality (g ood, evil, or
neutral), and the o t h er d escdbes attit udes toward
order (!awful, ch aotic, or neutral). These factors allow
fo r n ine possible combinations, such as Lawful
Good a nd Neutral Evil. See also chapter 2 ("Create
Your Cha rac ter ").
A LLY
A creature is your ally if it is a member of your
adventu ring pa rty, your fr iend, on your side in
combat, or a creatur e that the rules or the DM designa
tes as your ally.
AREA O F EFFECT
The descriptions of many spells and other features
specify that they have an area of effect, which typically
has one of six shapes. These shapes are defined
elsewhere in this glossary:
Cone
Cube
Cylinder
Emanation
Line
Sphere
An area of effect has a point of origin, a location
from which the effect's energy erupts. The rules for
each shape specify how to position its point of origin.
If all straight lines extending from the point of
origin to a location in the area of effect are blocked,
that location isn't included in the area of effect.
To block a line, an obstruction must provide Total
Cover. See also "Cover."
If the creator of an area of effect places it at an
unseen point and an obstruction-such as a wall- is
between the creator and that point, the point of
origin comes into being on the near side of the
obstruction.
ARMOR CLASS
An Armor Class (AC) is the target number for an
attack roll. AC represents how difficult it is to hit a
target.
Your base AC calculation is 10 plus your Dexterity
modifie r. If a rule gives you another base AC calculation,
you choose which calculation to use; you
can't use more than one. See also "Attack Roll."
ARMOR TRAI NING
Armor training allows you to use armor of a certain
category without the following drawbacks. If
you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack
t raining with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20
Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you
can't cast spells. If you use a Shield and lack training
with it, you don't gain its AC bonus. See also "Disadvantage"
and chapter 6 ("Armor").
ATTACK [ACTION]
When you take the Attack action, you can make one
attack roll with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.
Equipping and Unequipping Weapons. You can either
equip or unequip one weapon when you make
an attack as part of this action. You do so either
before or after the attack. If you equip a weapon
before an attack, you don't need to use it for that attack.
Equipping a weapon includes drawing it from
a sheath or picking it up. Unequipping a weapon
includes sheathing, stowing, or dropping it.
Moving between Attacks. If you move on your turn
and have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives
you more than one attack as part of the Attack action,
you can use some or all of that movement to
move between those attacks.
ATTACK ROLL
An attack roll is a D20 Test that represents making
an attack with a weapon, an Unarmed Strike, or a
spell. See also chapter 1 ("D20 Tests").
ATTITUDE
A monster has a starting attitude toward a player
character: Friendly, Hostile, or Indifferent. See also
"Friendly," "Hostile," "Indifferent," and "Influence."
ATTUNEMENT
Some magic items require a creature to form a
bond-called Attunement-with them before the
creature can use an item's magical properties. A
creature can have Attunement with no more than
three magic items at a time. See also chapter 6
("Magic Items").
BLINDED [CONDITION]
While you have the Blinded condition, you experience
the following effects.
Can't See. You can't see and automatically fail any
ability check that requires sight.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you
have Advantage, and your attack rolls have
Disadvantage.
J ·-
BLINDSIGHT
If you have Blindsight, you can see within a specific
range without relying on physical sight. Within that
range, you can see anything that isn't behind Total
Cover even if you have the Blinded condition or are
in Darkness. Moreover, in that range, you can see
something that has the Invisible condition.
APPENDIX CI RULES GLOSSARY 361
BLOODIED
A creature is Bloodied while it has half its Hit Points
or fewer remaining.
BONUS ACTION
A Bonus Action is a special action that you can take
on the same turn that you take an action . You can't
take more than one Bonus Action on a turn, and
you have a Bonus Action to take only if a rule ex plicitly
says so. See also chapter 1 ("Actions").

Objects can be harmed by attacks and by some
spells, using the rules below. If an object is exceedingly
fragile, the DM may allow a creature to break
it automatically with the Attack or Utilize action.
Armor Class. The Object Armor Class table suggests
ACs for various substances.
OBJECT ARMOR CLASS
AC Substance AC Substance
11 Cloth, paper, rope 19 Iron , steel
13 Crystal, glass, ice 21 Mithral
15 Wood 23 Adamantine
17 Stone
Hit Points. An object is destroyed when it has 0
Hit Points. The Object Hit Points table suggests Hit
Points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large
or smaller. To track Hit Points for a Huge or Gargantuan
object, divide it into Large or smaller sections,
and track each section's Hit Points separately.
The DM determines whether destroying part of an
object causes the whole thing to collapse.
OBJECT HtT POINTS

Tiny (bottle, lock) 2 (ld4) 5 (2d4)
Small (chest, lute) 3 (1 d6) 10 (3d6)

CHALLENGE R ATING
Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a
monster poses to a group of four player characters.
Compare a monster's CR to the characters' level.
If the CR is higher, the monster is likely a danger.
If the CR is lower, the monster likely poses little
t h reat. But circumstances and the number of player
characters can significantly alter how threatening
a monster is in actual play. The Dungeon Master's
Guide provides guidance to the DM on using CR
while planning potential combat encounters. See
also "Stat Block."
C H ARACTER SHEET
A character sheet is a paper or digital record that
you use to track your character's information. See
also chapter 2.
CHARMED [CONDITION]
While you have the Charmed condition, you experience
the following effects.
Can't Harm the Charmer. You can't attack the
charmer or target the charmer with damaging abilities
or magical effects.
Social Advantage. The charmer has Advantage on
any ability check to interact with you socially.
C LI , "' . I NG
While you're climbing, each foot of movement costs
1 extrn foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). You
ignore t his extra cost if you have a Climb Speed and
use i· o climb.
At the DM's option, climbing a slippery surface or
one with few handholds might require a successful
DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
CLIMB SPEED
A Climb Speed can be used in place of Speed to traverse
a vertical surface without expending the extra
movement normally associated with climbing. See
also "Climbing" and "Speed."
CONCENTRATION
Some spells and other effects require Concentration
to remain active, as specified in their descriptions.
If the effect's creator loses Concentration, the effect
ends. If the effect has a maximum duration, the effect's
description specifies how long the creator can
concentrate on it: up to 1 minute, 1 hour, or some
other duration. The creator can end Concentration
at any time (no action required). The following factors
break Concentration.
Another Concentration Effect. You lose Concentration
on an effect the moment you start casting
a spell that requires Concentration or activate another
effect that requires Concentration.
Damage. If you take damage, you must succeed on
a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration.
The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken
(round down}, whichever number is higher, up to a
maximum DC of 30.
Incapacitated or Dead. Your Concentration ends if
you have the Incapacitated condition or you die.
CONDITION
A condition is a temporary game state. The definition
of a condition says how it affects its recipient,
and various rules define how to end a condition.
This glossary defines these conditions:
Blinded Grappled Poisoned
Charmed Incapacitated Prone
Deafened Invisible Restrained
Exhaustion Paralyzed Stunned
Frightened Petrified Unconscious
A condition doesn't stack with itself; a recipient either
has a condition or doesn't. The Exhaustion condition
is an exception to that rule. See also chapter 1
("Conditions").
APPENDIX C I RULES GLOSSARY 363
CONE [AREA OF EFFECT]
A Cone is an area of effect that extends in straight
lines from a point of origin in a direction its creator
chooses. A Cone's width at any point along
its length is equal to that point's distance from ~he
point of origin. For example, a Cone is 15 feet wide
at a point along its length that is 15 feet fr om the .
point of origin. The effect that creates a Cone specifies
its maximum length.
A Cone's point of origin isn't included in the area
of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.
COV ER
Cover provides a degree of protection to a target
behind it. There are three degrees of cover, each
of which provides a different benefit to a target:
Half Cover (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving
throws), Three-Quarters Cover (+5 bonus to AC and
Dexterity saving throws), and Total Cover (can't be
targeted directly). If behind more than one degree
of cover, a target benefits only from the most protective
degree. See also chapter 1 ("Combat").

CURSES
Some game effects curse a creature or an object.
The effect that confers a curse defines what the
curse does. Curses can be removed by the Remove
Curse and Greater Restoration spells or other magic
that explicitly ends curses.
CYLINDER [A REA OF E FFEC T ]
A Cylinder is an area of effect that extends in
straight lines from a point of origin located at the
center of the circular top or bottom of the Cylinder.
The effect that creates a Cylinder specifies the radius
of the Cylinder's base and the Cylinder's height.
A Cylinder's point of origin is included in the area
of effect.
D20 TEST
D20 Tests en compass the three main d20 rolls of
the ga me: ability check s, attack rolls, and saving
throws. If somethi n g in t he game a ffe cts D20 Tests,
it a ffect s all three of these rolls. The DM determines
whether a D2 0 Te st is warranted in a given cir cumstance.
See also cha pter 1 ("D20 Tests").
D A MAGE
Damage represents harm that causes a c reat ure or
an object to lose Hit Points.
DAMAGE ROLL
A damage roll is a die roll, adjusted by any applicable
modifiers, that deals dam age to a target. See also
chapter 1 ("Damage and Heali ng").
DAMAGE TH RE SH O LD
A creature or an objec t t h at has a da mage threshold
has Immunity to all damage unless it takes an
amount of damage fro m a single attac k or effect
equal to or greater th an its d~mc1 ge t hreshold, in
wh ic h case i t takes tha t entire instance of damage
. Any d a m a ge that fails to meet or exceed the
d a m a ge t h r eshold is superficial and doesn't reduce
Hit Points. For example, if an object has a damage
thresho ld of 10, the object takes no damage if 9
d a m age is dealt to it, s ince that damage fails to
exceed the threshold. If the same object is dealt 11
dama g e , it takes all of that damage .

Speed of 3 0 feet, for example, you can move up to
60 fee t o n your turn if you Dash. If your Speed of
30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, you can move up to 30
feet this turn if you Dash.
If you have a special speed, such as a Fly Speed or
Swim Speed, you can use that speed instead of your
Speed when you take this action. You choose which
speed to use each time you take it. See also "Speed."
DEAD
A dead creature has no Hit Points and can't regain
them unless it is first revived by magic such as the
Raise Dead or Re v ivify spell. When such a spell is
cast, the spirit knows who is casting it and can refuse.
The spirit of a dead creature has left the body
and departed for the Outer Planes, and reviving the
creature requires calling the spirit back.
If the creature returns to life, the revival effect
determines the creature's current Hit Points. Unless
o therwise stated, the creature ret u rns to life with
any conditions, magical contagions, or curses that
were affecting it at death if the durations of those
effects are s till ongoing. If the creature died with
any Exhaustion levels , it returns with 1 fewer level.
If the creature had Attunement to one or more
magic items, it is no longer attuned to them.
DEAFENED [CONDITION]
While you have the Deafened condition , you experience
the following effect.
Can't Hear. You can't hear and automatically fail

EMANATION [AREA OF EFFECT]
An Emanation is an area of effect that extends in
straight lines from a creature or an object in all
directions. The effect that creates an Emanation
specifies the distance it extends.
An Emanation moves with the creature or object
that is its origin unless it is an instantaneous or a
stationary effect.
An Emanation's origin (creature or object) isn't included
in the area of effect unless its creator decides
otherwise.
ENCOUNTER
An encounter is a scene in an adventure that is part
of at least one of the game's three pillars: social interaction,
exploration, or combat. See also chapter 1

EXPERTISE
Expertise is a feature that enhances your use of a
skill proficiency. When you make an ability check
with a skill proficiency in which you have Expertise,
your Proficiency Bonus is doubled for that check
unless the bonus is doubled by another feature.
If you gain Expertise, you gain it in one skill in
which you have proficiency. You can't have Expertise
in the same skill proficiency more than once.
See also chapter 1 ("Proficiency").
f ALLING [HAZARD]
A creature that falls takes ld6 Bludgeoning damage
at the end of the fall for every 10 feet it fell, to
a maximum of 20d6. When the creature lands, it
has the Prone condition unless it avoids taking any
damage from the fall.
A creature that falls into water or another liquid

GRAPPLING
A creature can grapple another creature. Characters
typically grapple by using an Unarmed Strike.
Many monsters have special attacks that allow
them to quickly grapple prey. However a grapple is
initiated, it follows these rules. See also "Unarmed
Strike" and "Grappled."
Grappled Condition. Successfully grappling a creature
gives it the Grappled condition.
One Grapple per Hand. A creature must have a
hand free to grapple another creature. Some stat
blocks and game effects allow a creature to grapple
using a tentacle, a maw, or another body part.
Whatever part a grappler uses, it can grapple only
one creature at a time with that part, and the grappler
can't use that part to target another creature
unless it ends the grapple.
Escaping a Grapple. A Grappled creature can use
its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity
(Acrobatics) check against the grapple's escape
DC, ending the condition on itself on a success. The
condition also ends if the grappler has the Incapacitated
condition or if the distance between the Grappled
target and the grappler exceeds the grapple's

HELP [ACTION]
When you take the Help action, you do one of the
following.
Assist an Ability Check. Choose one of your
skill or tool proficiencies and one ally who is near
enough for you to assist verbally or physically when
they make an ability check. That ally has Advantage
on the next ability check they make with the chosen
skill or tool. This benefit expires if the ally doesn't
use it before the start of your next turn. The DM
has final say on whether your assistance is possible.
Assist an Attack Roll. You momentarily distract
an enemy within 5 feet of you, giving Advantage to
the next attack roll by one of your allies against that
enemy. This benefit expires at the start of your next
turn.
HEROIC INSPIRATION
If you (a player character) have Heroic Inspiration,
you can expend it to reroll any die immediately after
rolling it, and you must use the new roll.
If you gain Heroic Inspiration but already have it,
it's lost unless you give it to a player character who
lacks it.
HIDE [ACTION]
With the Hide action, you try to conceal yourself.
To do so, you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity
(Stealth) check while you're Heavily Obscured or
behind Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover, and
you must be out of any enemy's line of sight; if you
can see a creature, you can discern whether it can
see you.
On a successful check, you have the Invisible condition.

HIT POINT DICE
Hit Point Dice , or Hit Dice for short, help determine
a player character's Hit Point maximum, as
explained in chapter 2. Most monsters also have Hit
Dice. A creature can spend Hit Dice during a Short
Rest to regain Hit Points. See also "Short Rest."
HIT POINTS
Hit Points (HP) are a measure of how difficult it is
to kill or destroy a creature or an object. Damage
reduces Hit Points, and healing restores them. You
can't have more Hit Points than you r Hit Point
maximum, and you can't have less than 0. See also
"Breaking Objects" and chapter 1 ("Damage and
Healing").
HOSTILE [ATTITUDE]
A Hostile creature views you unfavorably. You have
Disadvantage on an ability check to influence a Hostile
creature. See also "Influence."
HOVER
Some creatures can hover, as noted in their stat
blocks, and some spells and other effects grant the
ability to hover. Hovering while flying prevents
you from falling in certain circumstances. See also
"Flying."
ILL US IONS
Spells and other effects sometimes create magical illusions.
Such an effect defines what the illusion does
and which senses or mental faculties it deceives.
If an illusion manifests in space, the illusion is
insubstantial and weightless, yet it seems to be affected
by the environment as if the illusion were
real unless the effect that created it specifies otherwise.
For example, a visual illusion of a creature
casts shadows and reflections, and wind appears
to affect the illusory creature . Similarly, an audible
illusion echoes in an echoey space.
IMMUNITY
If you have Immunity to a damage type or a condition,
it doesn't affect you in any way.
IMPROVISED WEAPONS
An improvised weapon is an object wielded as a
makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table leg,
or a frying pan. A Simple or Martial weapon also
counts as an improvised weapon if it's wielded in
a way contrary to its design; if you use a Ranged
weapon to make a melee attack or throw a Melee
weapon that lacks the Thrown property, the
weapon counts as an improvised weapon. An improvised
weapon follows the rules below.
Proficiency. Don't add your Proficiency Bonus to
attack rolls with an improvised weapon.
Damage. On a hit, the weapon deals ld4 damage of
a type the OM thinks is appropriate for the object.
Range. If you throw the weapon, it has a normal
range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
Weapon Equivalents. If an improvised weapon
resembles a Simple or Martial weapon, the DM may
say it functions as that weapon and uses that weapon's
rules. For example, the OM could treat a table
leg as a Club.
INC A PACITATED [CONDITION]
While you have the Incapacitated condition, you
exper ience the following effects.
Inactive. You can' t take any action, Bonus Action,
or Reaction.
No Concentration. Your Concentration is broken.
Sp eechless. You can't speak.
Surprised. If you're Incapacitated when you roll
Initiative, you have Disadvantage on the roll.
INDIFFERENT [ATTITUDE]
An Indifferent creature has no desire to help or
hinder you. Indifferent is the default attitude of a
monster. See also "Influence."
INFLUENCE [ACTION]
With the Influence action, you urge a monster to
do something. Describe or roleplay how you're
communicating with the monster. Are you trying
to deceive, intimidate, amuse, or gently persuade?
The DM then determines whether the monster feels
willing, unwilling, or hesitant due to your interaction;
this determination establishes whether an ability
check is necessary, as explained below.
Willing. If your urging aligns with the monster's
desires, no ability check is necessary; the monster
fulfills your request in a way it prefers.
Unwilling. If your urging is repugnant to the monster
or counter to its alignment, no ability check is
necessary; it doesn't comply.
Hesitant. If you urge the monster to do something
that it is hesitant to do, you must make an ability
check, which is affected by the monster's attitude:
Indifferent, Friendly, or Hostile, each of which is
defined in this glossary. The Influence Checks table
suggests which ability check to make based on
how you're interacting with the monster. The DM
chooses the check, which has a default DC equal to
15 or the monster's Intelligence score, whichever is
higher. On a successful check, the monster does as
urged. On a failed check, you must wait 24 hours
(or a duration set by the DM) before urging it in the
same way again.
INFLUENCE CHECKS
Ability Check Interaction
Charisma (Deception) Deceiving a monster

'..,---=INVISIBLE
[CONDITION]
While you have the Invisible condition, you experience
the following effects.
Surprise. If you're Invisible when you roll Initiative,
you have Advantage on the roll.
Concealed. You aren't affected by any effect that
requires its target to be seen unless the effect's creator
can somehow see you. Any equipment you are
wearing or carrying is also concealed.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Disadvantage, and your attack rolls have Advantage.
If a creature can somehow see you, you don't
gain this benefit against that creature.
JUMPING
When you jump, you make either a Long Jump (horizontal)
or a High Jump (vertical). See also "Long
Jump" and "High Jump."
------------
KNOCKING OUT A CREATURE
When you would reduce a creature to O Hit Points
with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the
creature to 1 Hit Point. The creature then has the
Unconscious condition and starts a Short Rest.
The creature remains Unconscious until it regains
any Hit Points or until someone uses an action to
administer first aid to it, which requires a successful
DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
LIGHTLY OBSCURED
You have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks to see something in a Lightly Obscured
space. See also "Dim Light" and chapter 1
("Exploration").
LINE [AREA OF EFFECT]
A Line is an area of effect that extends from a point
of origin in a straight path along its length and covers
an area defined by its width. The effect that creates
a Line specifies its length and width.
APPENDIX CI RULES GLOSSARY
A Line's point of origin isn't included in the area
of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.
LONGjUMP
When you make a Long Jump, you leap horizontally
a number of feet up to your Strength score if you
move at least 10 feet immediately before the jump.
When you make a standing Long Jump, you can leap
only half that distance. Either way, each foot you
jump costs a foot of movement.
If you land in Difficult Terrain, you must succeed
on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or have the
Prone condition.
This Long Jump rule assumes that the height of
the jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a
stream or chasm. At your DM's option, you must
succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to
clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the
jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise,
you hit the obstacle.
LONG REST
A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime-at
least 8 hours-available to any creature. During a
Long Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and perform
no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as
reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.
During sleep, you have the Unconscious condition.
After you finish a Long Rest, you must wait at least
16 hours before starting another one.
Benefits of the Rest. To start a Long Rest, you must
have at least 1 Hit Point. When you finish the rest,
you gain the following benefits:
Regain All HP. You regain all lost Hit Points and all
spent Hit Point Dice. If your Hit Point maximum
was reduced, it returns to normal.
Ability Scores Restored. If any of your ability
scores were reduced, they return to normal.
Exhaustion Reduced. If you have the Exhaustion
condition, its level decreases by 1.
Special Feature. Some features are recharged by a
Long Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges
in the way specified in its description.
Interrupting the Rest. A Long R12st i • stopped by
the following interruptions:
• Rolling Initiative
• Casting a spell other than a c c1 11, rir
Taking any damage
1 hour of walking or other physical exertion
If you rested at least 1 hour before the interruption,
you gain the benefits of a Short Rest. See also "Short
Rest."
You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an
interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 additional
hour per interruption to finish.
MAGIC [ACTIO N]
When you take the Magic action, you cast a spell
that has a casting time of an action or use a feature
or magic item that requires a Magic action to be
activated.
If you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 minute
or longer, you must take the Magic action on
each turn of that casting, and you must maintain
Concentration while you do so. If your Concentration
is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a
spell slot. See also "Concentration."
MAGICAL EFFECT
An effect is magical if it is created by a spell, a magic
item, or a phenomenon that a rule labels as magical.
MALN UTRITION [HAZARD]
A creature needs an amount of food per day based
on its size, as shown in the Food Needs per Day table.
A creature that eats but consumes less than half
the required food for a day must succeed on a DC
10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion
level at the day's end. A creature that eats nothing
for 5 days automatically gains 1 Exhaustion level at
the end of the fifth day as well as an additional level
at the end of each subsequent day without food.
Exhaustion caused by malnutrition can't be removed
until the creature eats the full amount of
food required for a day. See also "Exhaustion."

APPENDIX C I RULES GLOSSARY 371
PASSIVE PERCEPTION
Passive Perception is a score that reflects a creature's
general awareness of its surroundings. The
DM uses this score when determining whether a
creature notices something without consciously
making a Wisdom (Perception) check.
A creature's Passive Perception equals 10 plus the
creature's Wisdom (Perception) check bonus. If the
creature has Advantage on such checks, increase
the score by 5. If the creature has Disadvantage on
them, decrease the score by 5. For example, a level
1 character with a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency
in Perception has a Passive Perception of 14 (10 +
2 + 2). If that character has Advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks, the score becomes 19.

POSSESSION
Some effects cause a creature to be possessed by a nother
creature or entity. A possessing effect defi nes
how the possession operates. Possession can be prevented
by the Protection from Evil and Good spell and
ended by the Dispel Evil and Good spell.
PROFICIENCY
If you have proficiency with something, you can add
your Proficiency Bonus to any D20 Test you make
using that thing. A creature might have proficiency
in a skill or saving throw or with a weapon or tool.
See also chapter 1 ("Proficiency").
!, --
PRONE [CONDITION]
While you have the Prone condition, you experience
the following effects.
Restricted Movement. Your only movement options
are to crawl or to spend an amount of movement
equal to half your Speed (round down) to
right yourself and thereby end the condition. If your
Speed is 0, you can't right yourself.
Attacks Affected. You have Disadvantage on attack
rolls. An attack roll against you has Advantage if
the attacker is within 5 feet of you. Otherwise, that
attack roll has Disadvantage.
REACTION
A Reaction is a special action taken in response to
a trigger defined in the Reaction's description. You
can take a Reaction on another creature's turn, and
if you take it on your turn, you can do so even if you
also take an action, a Bonus Action, or both. Once
you take a Reaction, you can't take another one until
the start of your next turn. The Opportunity Attack
is a Reaction available to all creatures. See also
"Opportunity Attacks" and chapter 1 ("Actions").
READY [ACTION]
You take the Ready action to wait for a particular
circumstance before you act. To do so, you take this
action on your turn, which lets you act by taking a
Reaction before the start of your next turn.
First, you decide what perceivable circumstance
will trigger your Reaction. Then, you choose the
action you will take in response to that trigger, or
you choose to move up to your Speed in response
to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the
trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the
zombie steps next to me, J move aw~y."
W h e n the trigger occurs, you can either take your
Reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore
th e tri gger.
W hen you Ready a spell, you cast it as normal (exp
ending a n y resources used to cast it) but hold its
en e rgy, which you release with your Reaction when
the trigger occurs . To be readied, a spell must have
a c asting time of an action, and holding on to the
spell's magic requires Concentration, which you can
m a intain up to the start of your next t urn. If your
Concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without
taking effect.
RESISTANCE
If you have Resista nce to a damage type, damage of
th a t type is halved against you (round down) . Resistance
is applied only once to an instance of damage .
See also chapter 1 ("Damage and Healing") .
RESTRAINED [CONDITION]
While you have the Restrained condition, you experience
the following effects.
Speed 0. Your Speed is O and can' t increase.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you
have Advantage, and your attack rolls have
Disadvantage.
Saving Throws Affected. You have Disadvantage
on Dexterity saving throws.
RITUAL
If you have a spell prepared that has the Ritual tag,
you can cast that spell as a Ritual. The Ritual version
of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than
normal. It also doesn't expend a spell slot, which
means the ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a
higher level. See also chapter 7.
ROUND DOWN
Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the
game , round down if you end up with a fraction,
even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some
rules make an exception and tell you to round up.
S AVE
Save is another name for a saving throw. See also
"S avin g Throw."
S AVI NG THROW
A saving throw-also called a save-represents an
attempt to avoid or resist a threat. You normally
m ake n s aving throw only when a rule requires you
to do so, but you can decide to fail the save without
rolling. The result of a save is detailed in the effect
that allowed it. If a target is forced to make a save
and lacks the ability score used by it, the target automatically
fails. See also chapter 1 ("D20 Tests").
SEARCH [ACTION]
When you take the Search action, you make a Wisdom
check to discern s omething that isn' t obvious .
The Search table suggests which skills are applicable
when you take this action, depending on what
you ' re trying to detect.
SEARCH

SHAPE-SHIFTING
If an effect, such as Wild Shape or the Polymorph
spell , lets you shape-shift, its description specifies
what happens to you. Unless that description says
otherwise, any ongoing effects on you-conditions,
spells, curses, and the like-carry over from one
form to the other. You revert to your true form if
you die.
SHORT REST
A Short Rest is a 1-hour period of downtime, during
which a creature does nothing more strenuous than
reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. To start
a Short Rest, you must have at least 1 Hit Point.
Benefits of the Rest. When you finish the rest, you
gain the following benefits:
Spend Hit Point Dice. You can spend one or more
of your Hit Point Dice to regain Hit Points. For
each Hit Point Die you spend in this way, roll the
die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You
regain Hit Points equal to the total (minimum of 1
Hit Point). You can decide to spend an additional
Hit Point Die after each roll.
Special Feature. Some features are recharged by a
Short Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges
in the way specified in its description.
Interrupting the Rest. A Short Rest is stopped by
the following interruptions:
• Rolling Initiative
• Casting a spell other than a cantrip
• Taking any damage
An interrupted Short Rest confers no benefits.

SIMULTANEOUS EFFECTS
If two or more things happen at the same time on a
turn, the person at the game table-player or DMwhose
turn it is decides the order in which those
things happen. For example, if two effects occur at
the start of a player character's turn, the player decides
which of the effects happens first.
SIZE
A creature or an object belongs to a size category:
Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan.
A creature's size determines how much space the
creature occupies in combat. An object's size affects
its Hit Points. See also "Breaking Objects" and chapter
1 ("Combat").
SKILL
A skill is an area of specialization associated with
an ability check. If you have proficiency in a skill,
you can add your Proficiency Bonus when you make
an ability check associated with that skill. See also
chapter 1 ("Proficiency").
SPEED
A creature has a Speed, which is the distance in feet
the creature can cover when it moves on its turn.
See also "Climbing," "Crawling," "Flying," "Jumping,"
"Swimming" and chapter 1 ("Combat").
Special Speeds. Some creatures have special
speeds, such as a Burrow Speed, Climb Speed, Fly
Speed, or Swim Speed, each of which is defined
in this glossary. If you have more than one speed,
choose which one to use when you move; you can
switch between the speeds during your move.
Whenever you switch, subtract the distance already
moved from the new speed. The result determines
how much farther you can move. If the result is O or
less, you can't use the new speed during the current
move. For example, if you have a Speed of 30 and a
Fly Speed of 40, you could fly 10 feet, walk 10 feet,
and leap into the air to fly 20 feet more.
Changes to Your Speeds. If an effect increases or
decreases your Speed for a time, any special speed
you have increases or decreases by an equal amount

,,,.,h APPENDIX C ! RULES GLOSSARY
TELEPATHY
Telepathy is a magical ability that a llows a creature
to communicate mentally with another cr eature
within a specified range. Unless a rule states other wise,
the contacted creature doesn't need to share a
language with the telepath to understand t his communication,
but the contacted creature must be able
to understand at least one language or be telepathic
itself to understand.
A telepath doesn't need to see a contac ted creature,
and the telepath can start or end the telepathic
contact at any time (no action requi red). Telepathic
contact can't be initiated and is immediately broken
if either the telepath or the other creature has the
Incapacitated condition. Telepathic contact is also
broken if the contacted creature is no longer within
the telepathy's range or if the telepath contacts a
different creature within range.
A creature without telepathy can receive telepathic
messages but can't initiate a telepathic conversation.
Once a telepathic conversation starts,
the non-telepath can communicate mentally to the
telepath until the telepathic connection ends.
T'ELEPORTATION
Teleportation is a special kind of magical transportation.
If you teleport, you disappear and reappear
elsewhere instantly, without moving through the intervening
space. This transportation doesn't expend
movement unless a rule tells you otherwise, and
teleportation never provokes Opportunity Attacks.
When you teleport, all the equipment you're
wearing and carrying teleports with you. If you're
touching another creature when you teleport, that
creature doesn't teleport with you unless the teleportation
effect says otherwise.
If the destination space of your teleportation is
occupied by another creature or blocked by a solid
obstacle, you instead appear in the nearest unoccupied
space of your choice.
The description of a teleportation effect tells you
if you must see the teleportation's destination.
TEMPORARY HIT POINTS
Temporary Hit Points are granted by certain effects
and act as a buffer against losing real Hit Points. See
also chapter 1 ("Damage and Healing").
T,EMORSENSE
A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the
location of creatures and moving objects within
a specific range, provided that the creature with
Tremorsense and anything it is detecting are both in
contact with the same surface (such as the ground,
a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.
Tremorsense can't detect creatures or objects in
the a ir, and it doesn't count as a form of sight.
TRUE SIGHT
If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced
within a specified range. Within that range, your
vision pierces through the following:
Darkness. You can see in normal and magical
Darkness.
Invisibility. You see creatures and objects that have
the Invisible condition.
Visual Illusions. Visual illusions appear transparent
to you, and you automatically succeed on saving
throws against them.
Transformations. You discern the true form of any
creature or object you see that has been transformed
by magic.
Ethereal Plane. You see into the Ethereal Plane. See
also appendix A ("Transitive Planes").
UNARMED STRIKE
Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack,
you can use a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar
forceful blow. In game terms, this is an Unarmed
Strike-a melee attack that involves you using your
body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within 5
feet of you.
Whenever you use your Unarmed Strike, choose
one of the following options for its effect.
Damage. You make an attack roll against the target.
Your bonus to the roll equals your Strength
modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the
ta rget takes Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus
your Strength modifier.
Grapple. The target must succeed on a Strength
or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or it
has the Grappled condition. The DC for the saving
throw and any escape attempts equals 8 plus your
Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This
grapple is possible only if the target is no more than
one size larger than you and if you have a hand free
to gr ab it. See also "Grappling."
Shove. The target must succeed on a Strength
or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or
you either push it 5 feet away or cause it to have
the Prone condition. The DC for the saving throw
equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency
Bonus. This shove is possible only if the target
is no more than one size larger than you.
