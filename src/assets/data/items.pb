Dungeon Master's Guide	WTC A9219»…:GenericBÏThis viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two Objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with Oil of Slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of \Item{Universal Solvent} or \Item{Oil of Etherealness}, or with a \Spell{Wish} spell.J A very strong, milky-white glue.rsovereign_glue.jpg*
