Ü&Aboleth2!
Monster Manual	WTC A9218:GenericB‡%Before the coming of the gods, aboleths lurked in primordial oceans and underground lakes. They reached out with their minds and seized control of the burgeoning life-forms of the mortal realm, making those creatures their slaves. Their dominance made them like gods. Then the true gods appeared, smashing the aboleths' empire and freeing their slaves.

Aboleths have never forgotten.\subtitle{Eternal Memories.} Aboleths have flawless memories. They pass on their knowledge and experience from generation to generation. Thus, the injury of their defeat by the gods remains perfectly preserved in their minds.

Aboleths' minds are treasure troves of ancient lore, recalling moments from prehistory with perfect clarity. They plot patiently and intricately across eons. Few creatures can conceive of the extent of an aboleth's plan.\subtitle{Gods in the Lake.} Aboleths dwell in watery environments, including ocean abysses, deep lakes, and the \Place{Elemental Plane of Water}. In these domains and the lands that adjoin them, aboleths are like gods, demanding worship and obedience from their subjects. When they consume other creatures, aboleths add the knowledge and experiences of their prey to their eternal memories.

Aboleths use their telepathic powers to read the minds of creatures and know their desires. An aboleth uses this knowledge to gain a creature's loyalty, promising to fulfill such wants in exchange for obedience. Within its lair, the aboleth can further use its powers to override senses, granting creatures, such as its followers, the illusion of promised rewards.\subtitle{Enemies of the Gods.} The aboleths' fall from power is written in stark clarity on their flawless memories, for aboleths never truly die. If an aboleth's body is destroyed, its spirit returns to the \Place{Elemental Plane of Water}, where a new body coalesces for it over days or months.

Ultimately, aboleths dream of overthrowing the gods and regaining control of the world. Aboleths have had untold eons to plot and to prepare their plans for perfect execution.\title{An Aboleth's Lair} Aboleths lair in subterranean lakes or the rocky depths of the ocean, often surrounded by the ruins of an ancient, fallen aboleth city. An aboleth spends most of its existence underwater, surfacing occasionally to treat with visitors or deranged worshipers.\subtitle{Lair Action} When fighting inside its lair, an aboleth can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the aboleth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\list{The aboleth casts \Spell{phantasmal force} (no components required) on any number of creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. While maintaining concentration on this effect, the aboleth can't take other lair actions. If a target succeeds on the saving throw or if the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the aboleth's phantasmal force lair action for the next 24 hours, although such a creature can choose to be affected.}{Pools of water within 90 feet of the aboleth surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone. The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has used a different one.}{Water in the aboleth's lair magically becomes a conduit for the creature's rage. The aboleth can target any number of creatures it can see in such water within 90 feet of it. A target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage. The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has used a different one.}\subtitle{Regional Effects} The region containing an aboleth's lair is warped by the creature's presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:\list{Underground surfaces within 1 mile of the aboleth's lair are slimy and wet and are difficult terrain.}{Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the aboleth that drink such water vomit it within minutes.}{As an action, the aboleth can create an illusory image of itself within 1 mile of the lair. The copy can appear at any location the aboleth has seen before or in any location a creature charmed by the aboleth can currently see. Once created, the image lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and can move like the aboleth. The aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the image's position as if present at that position. If the image takes any damage, it disappears.}

If the aboleth dies, the first two effects fade over the course of 3d10 days.JOnce the masters of the mortal realm, aboleths plot their revenge against the gods, fueled by their eternal memories and unwavering ambition.raboleth.png(08B

The charmed target is under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.

Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.Òœ

Monster Manual	WTC A9218ØØ:GenericB‘It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The bandit captain has these qua lities in spades.

In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the pirate captain is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.

More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain's colorful reputation.JThe head of a gang of banditsrbandit captain.jpeg(8

¢Basilisk2!
Monster Manual	WTC A9218:GenericBêTravelers sometimes find objects that look like pieces of remarkably lifelike stone carvings of wildlife. Missing parts appear to have been bitten off. Seasoned explorers regard such relics as warnings, knowing that the basilisk that created them is likely to be nearby.\subtitle{Adaptable Predators.} Basilisks thrive in arid, temperate, or tropical climates. They lair in caves or other sheltered sites. Most often, basilisks are encountered underground.

A basilisk born and raised in captivity can be domesticated and trained. Such a trained basilisk knows how to avoid meeting the eyes of those its master wishes to protect from its gaze, but it makes a daunting guardian beast. Because of this use, basilisk eggs are highly prized.\subtitle{Gaze of Stone.} Basilisks are ponderous for hunting creatures, but they needn't chase prey. Meeting a basilisk's supernatural gaze can be enough to affect a rapid transformation, transforming a victim into porous stone. Basilisks, with their strong jaws, are able to consume the stone. The stone returns to organic form in the basilisk's gullet.

Some alchemists are said to know how to process the basilisk's gullet and the fluids contained within. Properly handled, the gullet produces an oil that can return petrified creatures to flesh and life. Unfortunately for such a victim, any parts lost in stone form remain absent if the creature revives. Revivification using the oil is impossible if a vital part of the petrified creature, such as its head, is detached.JnTravelers find broken stone wildlife carvings near basilisks, a sign of the creature's deadly petrifying gaze.rbasilisk.webp(08BJ (0’<¢ªÊ
Petrifying Gaze¶If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is \Condition{restrained}. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure , the creature is \Condition{petrified} until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.º5

Æ&Beholder2!
Monster Manual	WTC A9218:GenericBÔ%One glance at a beholder is enough to assess its foul and otherworldly nature. Aggressive, hateful, and greedy, these aberrations dismiss all other creatures as lesser beings, toying with them or destroying them as they choose.

A beholder's spheroid body levitates at all times, and its great bulging eye sits above a wide, toothy maw, while the smaller eyestalks that crown its body twist and turn to keep its foes in sight. When a beholder sleeps, it closes its central eye but leaves its smaller eyes open and alert.

\sub{Xenophobic Isolationists.} Enemies abound, or so every beholder believes. Beholders are convinced that other creatures resent them for their brilliance and magical power, even as they dismiss those lesser creatures as crude and disgusting. Beholders always suspect others of plotting against them, even when no other creatures are around.

The disdain a beholder has for other creatures extends to other beholders. Each beholder believes its form to be an ideal, and that any deviation from that form is a flaw in the racial purity of its kind. Beholders vary greatly in their physical forms, making conflict between them inevitable. Some beholders are protected by overlapping chitinous plates. Some have smooth hides. Some have eyestalks that writhe like tentacles, while others' stalks bear crustacean-like joints. Even slight differences of coloration in hide can turn two beholders into lifelong enemies.

\sub{Eye Tyrant.} Some beholders manage to channel their xenophobic tendencies into a terrible despotism. ather than live in isolation, the aptly named eye tyrants enslave those other creatures, founding and controlling vast empires. An eye tyrant sometimes carves out a domain within or under a major city, commanding networks of agents that operate on their master's behalf.

\sub{Alien Lairs.} Because they refuse to share territory with others, most beholders withdraw to frigid hills, bandoned ruins, and deep caverns to scheme. A beholder's lair is carved out by its disintegration eye ray, emphasizing vertical passages connecting chambers stacked on top of each other. Such an environment allows a beholder to move freely, even as it prevents intruders from easily creeping about. When intruders do break in, the height of its open ceilings allows a beholder to float up and harry foes on the floor.

As alien as their creator, the rooms in a beholder's lair reflect the creature's arrogance. It festoons its chambers with trophies from the battles it has won, including petrified adventurers standing frozen in their horrified final moments, pieces of other beholders, and magic items wrested from powerful fo es. A beholder judges its own worth by its acquisitions, and it never willingly parts with its treasures.

\title{A Beholder's Lair}A beholder's central lair is typically a large, spacious cavern with high ceilings, where it can attack without fear of closing to melee range. A beholder encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 14 (11,500 XP).

\subtitle{Lair Actions}When fighting inside its lair, a beholder can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the beholder can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:

\list{A 50-foot square area of ground within 120 feet of the beholder becomes slimy; that area is difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round.}{Walls within 120 feet of the beholder sprout grasping appendages until initiative count 20 on the round after next. Each creature of the beholder's choice that starts its turn within 10 feet of such a wall must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.}{An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of the beholder. One random eye ray of the beholder shoots from that eye at a target of the beholder's choice that it can see. The eye then closes and disappears. The beholder can't repeat an effect until they have all been used, and it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.}\subtitle{Regional Effects}A region containing a beholder's lair is warped by the creature's'unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

\list{Creatures within 1 mile of the beholder's lair sometimes feel as if they're being watched when they aren't.}{When the beholder sleeps, minor warps in reality occur within 1 mi1e of its lair and then vanish 24 hours later. Marks on cave walls might change subtly, an eerie trinket might appear where none existed before, harmless slime might coat a statue, and so on. These effects apply only to natural surfaces and to nonmagical objects that aren't on anyone's person.}If the beholder dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.J(A floating abomination with deadly eyes.rbeholder.webp(08BBJ

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.}{\em{4. Slowing Ray.} The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute . In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not bofh. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.}{\em{5. Enervation Ray.} The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.}{\em{6. Telekinetic Ray.} If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated.

If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.}{\em{7. Sleep Ray.} The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.}{\em{8. Petrification Ray.} The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure , the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.}{\em{9. Disintegration Ray.} If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.

If the target is a Large or smaller non magical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If th e target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.}{\em{10.

ûBlack ViperHuman2-
Waterdeep - Dragon Heist	WTC C4658ÄÄ:GenericBÎThe Black Viper was a notorious burglar, pickpocket, mugger, and assassin who died a century ago, after a long and nefarious career. Esvele Rosznar, a brash young noble, has recently adopted the Black Viper's persona to lead a secret life of crime. Like many other nobles, Esvele gossips about the Black Viper's exploits to lend credence to the villain's mystique.

The Rosznar family was convicted of slave trading - highly illegal in Waterdeep and banished over a hundred years ago, but has since returned. The Rosznars' inability to regain the respect they feel they deserve rankles them. The slave trade has continued in Amn and elsewhere, and it's not like other noble houses don't have skeletons in their closets. But just because of a little family squabble that went public, the \Group{Rosznar} name has been said with a sneer for a century. As part of the family's constant effort to prove this conception wrong and win others' respect, Esvele has been brought up to be the most proper noble possible, partaking in lessons of etiquette, dance, and poise as befits someone of her station.

In her younger days, Esvele openly rebelled, but that behavior led to locked doors at night and house guards watching her every move during the day. So she taught herself how to pick locks, pluck keys from belts and pouches, clamber up walls, and sneak past guards - playing the perfect daughter by day while cutting loose at night. To hide her identity from those she met, she wore a hood and mask, exchanging her fine clothes for the kind of practical clothing her parents would never let her wear.

One of the things Esvele has learned is to embrace the legend of the Black Viper. When she throws back her cloak to reveal the costume she has put together, most folk toss their purses and flee. If that doesn't work, she usually needs only to draw her dagger. Of course, some of the nobles she targets are made of sterner stuff, so Esvele has learned how to fight as well. She knows she's playing a dangerous game, but is satisfied that at least one member of the Rosznar family is earning the respect of Waterdeep's nobility.JJThe reincarnation of a notorious burgler, pickpocket, mugger and assassin.rblack viper.webp(8J (0Zbš

œBoggle2-
Volo's Guide to Monsters	WTC B8682€€:GenericB±Boggles are the little bogeys of fairy tales. They lurk in the fringes of the \Place{Feywild} and are also found on the \Place{Material Plane}, where they hide under beds and in closets, waiting to frighten and bedevil folk with their mischief.

A boggle is born out of feelings of loneliness, materializing in a place where the \Place{Feywild} touches the world in proximity to an intelligent being that feels isolated or abandoned. For example, a forsaken child might unintentionally conjure a boggle and see it as a sort of imaginary friend. A boggle might also appear in the attic of a lonely widower's house or in the caves of a hermit.

\bold{\em{Irksome Pests.}} Boggles engage in petty pranks to amuse themselves, passing the time at their hosts' expense. A boggle isn't above breaking dishes, hiding tools, making frightening sounds to startle cows and sour their milk, or hiding a baby in an attic. Although a boggle's antics might cause distress and unintentional harm, mischief - not mayhem - is usually its intent. If threatened, a boggle flees rather than stand and fight.

\bold{\em{Oily Excretions.}} A boggle excretes an oil from its pores and can make its oil slippery or sticky. The oil dries up and disappears an hour later.

\bold{\em{Twisting Space.}} A boggle can create magical openings to travel short distances or to pilfer items that would otherwise be beyond its reach. To create such a rift in space, a boggle must be adjacent to a space defined by a frame, such as an open window or a doorway, a gap between the bars of a cage, or the opening between the feet of a bed and the floor. The rift is invisible and disappears after a few seconds - enough time for the boggle to step, reach, or attack through it.

\bold{\em{Unreliable Allies.}} A boggle makes a decent servant for a strong-willed master, and wicked creatures such as \Monster[fomorian]{fomorians} and \Monster[hag]{hags} sometimes shelter boggles in their lairs. \Class{Warlocks} who form pacts with \Monster{archfey} have also been known to command boggles, and charismatic individuals who make the right offers have enjoyed temporary alliances with these little tricksters. A bored boggle always finds some way to entertain itself.JA mischievous little fey.rboggle.webp(8BBJ (0bz’<š

Boggle OilÑThe boggle excretes nonflammable oil from its pores. The boggle chooses whether the oil is slippery or sticky and can change the oil on its skin from one consistency to another as a bonus action.

\em{Slippery Oil.} While coated in slippery oil, the \Monster{boggle} gains advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to escape bonds, squeeze through narrow spaces, and end grapples.

\em{Sticky Oil.} While coated in sticky oil, the boggle gains advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to grapple and any ability check made to maintain a hold on another creature, a surface, or an object. The boggle can also climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.ªë
Dimensional RiftÖAs a bonus action, the boggle can create an invisible and immobile rift within an opening or frame it can see within 5 feet of it, provided that the space is no bigger than 10 feet on any side. The dimensional rift bridges the distance between that space and any point within 30 feet of it that the \Monster{boggle} can see or specify by distance and direction (such as â€œ30 feet straight upâ€). While next to the rift, the \Monster{boggle} can see through it and is considered to be next to the destination as well, and anything the boggle puts through the rift (including a portion of its body) emerges at the destination. Only the boggle can use the rift, and it lasts until the end of the \Monster{boggle}â€™s next turn.ª[

Oil Puddle†The \Monster{boggle} creates a puddle of oil that is either slippery or sticky (boggleâ€™s choice). The puddle is 1 inch deep and covers the ground in the boggleâ€™s space. The puddle is difficult terrain for all creatures except boggles and lasts for 1 hour.

If the oil is slippery, any creature that enters the puddleâ€™s area or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

If the oil is sticky, any creature that enters the puddleâ€™s area or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or be restrained. On its turn, a creature can use an action to try to extricate itself from the sticky puddle, ending the effect and moving into the nearest safe unoccupied space with a successful DC 11 Strength check.

Dungeon Master's Guide	WTC A9219ii:GenericB­Brown mold is a dungeon hazard, not a real monster. Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from anything around it. A patch of brown mold typically covers a 10-foot square, and the temperature within 30 feet of it is always frigid.

When a creature moves to within 5 feet of the mold for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Brown mold is immune to fire, and any source of fire brought within 5 feet of a patch causes it to instantly expand outward in the direction of the fire, covering a 10-foot-square area (with the source of the fire at the center of that area). A patch of brown mold exposed to an effect that deals cold damage is instantly destroyed.J3Brown mold is a dungeon hazard, not a real monster.rbrown mold.webp

\em{\bold{Goblinoids.}} Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, \Monster{hobgoblins} and \Monster{goblins}. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.

\em{\bold{Followers of Hruggek.} Bugbears worship \God{Hruggek}, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of \Place{Acheron}. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek's side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.

\em{\bold{Venal Ambushers.} Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They a re fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.J(Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem.rbugbear.jpeg

æBullywug2!
Monster Manual	WTC A9218##:GenericB·Life as a bullywug is nasty, brutish, and wet. These frog-headed amphibious humanoids must stay constantly moist, dwelling in rainy forests, marshes, and damp caves. Always hungry and thoroughly evil, bullywugs overwhelm opponents with superior numbers when they can, but they flee from serious threats to search for easier prey.

Bullywugs have green, gray, or mottled yellow skin that shifts through shades of gray, green, and brown, allowing them to blend in with their surroundings. They wear crude armor and wield simple weapons, and can deliver a powerful bite to foes that press too close.\subtitle{Foul Aristocracy.} Bullywugs consider themselves the right and proper rulers of the swamps. They follow an etiquette of sorts when dealing with outsiders and each other, subject to the whims and fancies of their leader - a self-styled lord of the muck. Bullywugs introduce themselves with grand-sounding titles, make great shows of bowing and debasing themselves before their superiors, and endlessly vie to win their superiors' favor.

A bullywug has two ways to advance among its kind. It can either murder its rivals, though it must take pains to keep its criminal deeds secret, or it can find a treasure or magic item and present it as tribute or a token of obeisance to its liege. A bullywug that murders its rivals without cunning is likely to be executed, so it's more common for bullywugs to stage raids against caravans and settlements, with the goal of securing precious baubles to impress their lords and win their good graces. Invariably, such fine goods are reduced to filthy tatters through abuse and neglect. Once a gift loses its sheen, a bullywug lord invariably demands that its subjects bring it more treasure as tribute.\subtitle{Unruly Diplomacy.} Bullywugs love nothing more than lording over those who trespass on their territories. Their warriors attempt to capture intruders rather than simply slaying them.

Captives are dragged before the king or queen - a bullywug of unusually large size - and forced to beg for mercy. Bribes, treasure, and flattery can trick the bullywug ruler into letting its captives go, but not before it tries to impress its 'guests' with the majesty of its treasure and its realm. Struck with a deep inferiority complex, bullywug lords fancy themselves as kings and queens, but desperately crave the fear and respect of outsiders.\subtitle{Amphibian Allies.} Bullywugs speak a language that allows them to communicate over large areas by croaking like frogs. News of intruders or other events in the swamp spread within minutes across this crude communication system.

Simple concepts in the language are understandable to frogs and toads. Bullywugs use this capability to form strong bonds with giant frogs, which they train as guardians and hunters. Larger specimens are sometimes used as mounts as well. The frogs' ability to swallow creatures whole provides a bullywug hunting band an easy means of carrying prey back to their villages.JeAlways hungry and thoroughly evil, bullywugs overwhelm opponents with superior numbers when they can.rbullywug.webp

They aggressively attack any creature that trespasses on their territory or disturbs their feasting.\subtitle{Carrion Eaters.} A carrion crawler follows the scent of death to its food, but it prefers not to compete with other scavengers. These foul creatures thus hunker down in territories where death is plentiful and other carrion eaters have limited mobility. Caves, sewers, dungeons, and forested marshes are their favored lairs, but carrion crawlers are also drawn to battlefields and cemeteries.

A carrion crawler roams on the hunt, its tentacles probing the a ir for the scent of blood or decay. In tunnels or ruins, carrion crawlers scurry across the ceiling as they move toward food. In this way, they avoid contact with oozes, otyughs, and other dangerous inhabitants of the darkness, even as they surprise potential meals that don't think to look up.

\subtitle{Patient Predators.} Whether in subterranean darkness or while hunting at night, light signals a potential meal. A carrion crawler might follow a light source from a distance for hours, hoping to pick up the scent of blood. Despite their great size, carrion crawlers can also easily set up ambushes by waiting around blind corners for prey to come to them.

When facing potential prey or intruders, a carrion crawler lets its poison do the work. Once a victim goes rigiq wit~ paralysis, the carrion crawler wraps it with its tentacles and drags it away to a high ledge or isolated passageway, where it can be killed safely. The monster then resumes patrolling its territory while waiting for its meal to ripen.JZCarrion crawlers scour putrid flesh from carcasses and gobble the slimy bQnes that remain.rcarrion crawler.webp(08BBJ (0b’<¢ªa

ÜCave Fisher2-
Volo's Guide to Monsters	WTC B8682‚‚:GenericB¨A cave fisher is a subterranean arachnid with a long snout that houses spinnerets, enabling the creature to produce sticky filament, much like the strands of a spider's webbing, which the creature uses to snag prey.\subtitle{Ambushers.} A cave fisher usually hunts small animals and is fond of bats, so it stretches its filament over an opening that such prey might travel through. It then climbs to a hiding spot and adheres itself to the surface to rest and wait. When prey blunders into the filament, the cave fisher reels in its meal. A group of cave fishers might work together to cover a large area with filaments, but as soon as one captures potential food, every cave fisher in the area competes for the prize. If a victim escapes from the initial ambush, a cave fisher can reclaim its prey by shooting a filament out to capture it again.\subtitle{Moving Up in the World.} Scarce food might draw a group of cave fishers up to the surface, into a shadowy canyon or a gloomy forest that features both native animal prey and creatures such as explorers or travelers occasionally moving through the area.

A cave fisher instinctively knows that larger targets such as humanoids are more difficult to overcome, so the creatures shy away from attacking such prey unless they come across a solitary target. They might try to pick off a scout moving ahead of a group of travelers or a straggler lagging behind, rather than attracting the attention of the entire group.\subtitle{Valuable Innards.} Nearly every part of a cave fisher is useful after the creature has been dispatched. Its blood is alcoholic and tastes like strong liquor. Several dwarven spirits include cave fisher blood as part of the recipe, and some dwarves, especially berserkers, drink the blood straight. If they are gathered after being extruded, cave fisher filaments can be woven into rope that is thin, tough, and nearly invisible. Cave fisher meat is edible, tasting much like crab cooked in strong wine. The creature's shell is used in the manufacture of tools, armor, and jewelry.\subtitle{Reluctant Servants.} While some folk hunt cave fishers to kill them for their filaments and their blood, others capture cave fisher eggs and rear the hatchlings. Cave fishers have a natural aversion to fire, since their blood is flammable. As such, \Monster{chitines} and \Monster{hobgoblins} sometimes use the threat of fire to train cave fishers, then employ them to guard passages or as beasts of war.J×A cave fisher is a subterranean arachnid with a long snout that houses spinnerets, enabling the creature to produce sticky filament, much like the strands of a spider's webbing, which the creature uses to snag prey.rcave fisher.webp(08	BBJ

Adhesive FilamentêThe cave fisher can use its action to extend a sticky filament up to 60 feet, and the filament adheres to anything that touches it.

The filament can be attacked (AC 15; 5 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage), but a weapon that fails to sever it becomes stuck to it, requiring an action and a successful DC 13 Strength check to pull free.

Monster Manual	WTC A9218'':GenericBÊChimeras were created after mortals summoned \God{Demogorgon} to the world. The Prince of Demons, unimpressed with the creatures that surrounded it, transformed them into horrific, multi-headed monstrosities. This act gave rise to the first chimeras.

Gifted with demonic cruelty, a chimera serves as a grim reminder of what happens when demon princes find their way to the \Place{Material Plane}. A typical specimen has the hindquarters of a large \Monster{goat}, the forequarters of a \Monster{lion}, and the leathery wings of a \Monster{dragon}, along with the heads of all three of those creatures. The monster likes to surprise its victims, swooping down from the sky arid engulfing prey with its fiery breath before landing.\subtitle{Conflicted Creature.} A chimera combines the worst aspects of its three parts. Its \Monster{dragon} head drives it to raid, plunder, and accumulate a great hoard. Its \Monster[lion]{leonine} nature compels it to hunt and kill powerful creatures that threaten its territory. Its \Monster{goat} head grants it a vicious, stubborn streak that compels it to fight to the death.

These three aspects drive a chimera to stake out a territory that is as large as 10 miles wide. It preys on wild game, viewing more powerful creatures as rivals to be humiliated and defeated. Its greatest rivals are \Monster{dragons}, \Monster{griffons}, \Monster{manticores}, \Monster{perytons}, and \Monster{wyverns}.

When it hunts, the chimera looks for easy ways to amuse itself. It enjoys the fear and suffering of weaker creatures. The monster often toys with its prey, breaking off an attack prematurely and leaving a creature wounded and terrified before returning to finish it off.\subtitle{Servant of Evil.} Though chimeras are far from cunning, their draconic ego makes them susceptible to flattery and gifts. If offered food and treasure, a might spare a traveler. A villain can lure a chimara into service by keeping it well fed and its treasure hoard well stocked.JA mix of goat, lion and dragon.rchimera.png(	08BB<J (0

Monster Manual	WTC A9218VV:GenericB…The \Monster[black dragon]{black}, \Monster[blue dragon]{blue}, \Monster[green dragon]{green}, \Monster[red dragon]{red}, and \Monster{white dragons} represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures - including each other.\subtitle{Driven by Greed.} Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have 'stolen' it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.\subtitle{Creatures of Ego.} Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.\subtitle{Dangerous Lairs.} A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.

Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A \Monster{black dragon} might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a \Monster{red dragon} might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.\subtitle{Queen of Evil Dragons.} \God{Tiamat} the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on \Place{Avernus}, the first layer of the \Place{Nine Hells}. As a lesser god, \God{Tiamat} has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.

\GOd{Tiamat} is a gigantic \Monster{dragon} whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her - black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.

\God{Tiamat}'s most hated enemy is \God{Bahamut} the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for \God{Asmodeus}, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the \God{Dragon Queen}'s power.JvChromatic dragons are greedy, arrogant tyrants who hoard wealth and see themselves as superior to all other creatures.

ÀChuul2!
Monster Manual	WTC A9218((:GenericBØSurvivors of the ancient \Monster{aboleth} empire, chuuls are crustaceans the \Monster{aboleths} modified and endowed with sentience. They follow the ingrained directives of their creators, as they have done since the dawn of time.\subtitle{Primeval Relics.} In the primeval ages, \Monster{aboleths} ruled a vast empire that spanned the oceans of the world. In those days, the \Monster{aboleths} used mighty magic and bent the minds of the nascent creatures of the mortal realm. However, they were bound to the water and could not enforce their will beyond it without servants. Therefore, they created chuuls.

 Perfectly obedient, the chuuls collected sentient creatures and magic at the \Monster{aboleths}' command. Chuuls were designed to endure the ages of the world, growing in size and strength as the eons passed. When the \Monster{aboleths}' empire crumbled with the rise of the gods, the chuuls were cast adrift. However, these creatures continue to do what they did for the \Monster{aboleths}, slowly collecting humanoids, gathering treasure, amassing magic, and consolidating power.\subtitle{Tireless Guardians.} Chuul still guard the ruins of the ancient \Monster{aboleth} empire. They linger in silent observance of eons-old commands. Rumors and ancient maps sometimes lure treasure seekers to these ruins, but the reward for their boldness is death.

Whatever riches that the explorers bring with them adds to the hoard guarded by the chuuls. Chuuls can sense magic at a distance. This sense couples with an innate drive that leads them to slay explorers, take their gear, and bury it in secret locales \Monster{aboleths} dictated eons ago.\subtitle{Waiting Servants.} Although the \Monster{aboleths}' ancient empire fell long ago, the psychic bonds between them and their created servants remain intact. Chuuls that come into contact with \Monster{aboleths} immediately assume their old roles. Such chuuls redirect their compulsions to the service of the \Monster{aboleths}' sinister purposes.J¤Born from the \Monster{aboleths}' empire, chuuls are loyal guardians of their ancient ruins, awaiting the return of their creators to serve their sinister purposes.r	chuul.png(	08BBJ

ÇCloaker2!
Monster Manual	WTC A9218)):GenericB®Cloakers earned their names for the resemblance they bear to dark leathery cloaks. Lurking in remote dungeons and caves, these stealthy predators wait to slay lone or injured prey stumbling through the darkness.\subtitle{Camouflaged Lurkers.} Like a \Monster{stingray}, a cloaker's body is composed of cartilage and muscle. With its tail and fins unfurled, it flies through darkness and lurks among the shadows of caverns the same way a stingray glides through water and hides on the ocean floor. Parallel rows of round, black eyespots run along its back like buttons, and the ivory-colored claws on its cowl resemble bone clasps.

When a cloaker unfurls and moves to attack, it reveals its pale underside and makes its true nature evident. Red eyes glow above rows of sharp teeth, and a long pendulous tail whips behind it.\subtitle{Opportunistic Predators.} When hunting, cloakers glide through the shadows at a safe distance behind groups of other creatures traversing the \Place{Underdark}. They follow parties of humanoids to prey on the wounded after a battle, or pursue herds of \Place{Underdark} beasts, attacking the sick, the weak, or the straggling.

Cloakers strike quickly and consume their meals as swiftly as possible, enveloping and devouring their victims. While it feeds, a cloaker uses its swift, whiplike tail for defense, although it rarely takes a stand against dangerous foes or groups of creatures. As an added defense, cloakers can create illusory duplicates of themselves.\subtitle{Haunting Moan.} Cloakers' thoughts are alien to other life-forms, and they communicate with one another through subsonic moans inaudible to most creatures. At higher intensities, a cloaker's haunting moan becomes audible, evoking sensations of doom and dread in creatures that hear it.\subtitle{Cloaker Conclaves.} Cloakers prefer isolation, but they sometimes convene with other cloakers for defense or to exchange information about new dangers, suitable hunting grounds, or developments that might affect their habitats. When this convergence is complete, the cloakers separate again.JRCloakers earned their names for the resemblance they bear to dark leathery cloaks.rcloaker.png(08B

0Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)®The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.

Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

¼Crawling Claw2!
Monster Manual	WTC A9218,,:GenericBCrawling claws are the severed hands of murderers animated by dark magic so that they can go on killing. Wizards and warlocks of a dark bent use crawling claws as extra hands in their labors.

\subtitle{Magical Origins.} Through dark necromantic rituals, the life force of a murderer is bound to its severed hand, haunting and animating it. If a dead murderer's spirit a lready manifests as another undead creature, if the murderer is raised from death, or if the spirit has long passed on to another plane, the ritual fails. The ritual invoked to create a crawling claw works best with a hand recently severed from a murderer. To this end, ritualists and their servants frequent public executions to gain possession of suitable hands, or make bargains with assassins and torturers.

\subtitle{Creator's Control.} A crawling claw can't be turned, nor can it be controlled by spells that control undead. These foul monsters are entirely bound to the will of their creator, which can concentrate on a claw in sight to mentally command its every action. If the crawling claw's creator doesn't command it, the claw follows its last command to the best of its ability. Commands given to a crawling claw must be simple. A claw can't be tasked with finding and killing a particular person, because its limited senses and intelligence prevent it from tracking and picking out specific individuals. However, a command to kill all creatures in a particular locale works. A crawling claw can easily feel out the contours of keys and doorknobs, crawling from room to room on a blind killing spree.

\subtitle{Malign Intelligence.} A crawling claw possesses little of the intellect and memories of the individual of which it was once a living part. The hate, jealousy, or greed that drove that person to murder lingers on, however, amplified by the claw's torturous fragmented state. Left to its own devices, a crawling claw imitates and recreates the same murderous acts it committed in life.

\subtitle{Living Claws.} If a crawling claw is animated from the severed hand of a still-living murderer, the ritual binds the claw to the murderer's soul. The disembodied hand can then return to its former limb, its undead flesh knitting to the living arm from which it was severed. Made whole again, the murderer acts as though the hand had never been severed and the ritual had never taken place. When the crawling claw separates again, the living body falls into a coma. Destroying the crawling claw while it is away from the body kills the murderer. However, killing the murderer has no effect on the crawling claw.

\subtitle{Undead Nature.} A crawling claw doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.JhCrawling claws are the severed hands of murderers animated by dark magic so that they can go on killing.rcrawling claw.jpg(8BJ

Monster Manual	WTC A921801:GenericB·The immortality granted to a \Monster{lich} lasts only as long as it feeds mortal souls to its phylactery. If it falters or fails in that task, its bones turn to dust until only its skull remains. This 'demilich' contains only a fragment of the \Monster{lich}'s malevolent life force - just enough so that if it is disturbed, these remains rise into the air and assume a wraithlike form. The skull then emits a terrifying howl that can slay the weak-hearted and leave others trembling with fear. Left alone, it sinks back down and returns to the empty peace of its existence.

Few liches seek to become demiliches, for it means an end to the existence they hoped to preserve by becoming undead. However, time can erode the \Monster{lich}'s reason and memory, causing it to retreat into its ancient tomb and forget to feed on souls. The spells it once knew fade from its mind, and it no longer channels the arcane energy it wielded as a \Monster{lich}. However, even as a mere skull it remains a deadly and vexing enemy.\subtitle{Enduring Existence.} Even after a \Monster{lich} is reduced to a demilich state, its phylactery survives. As long as its phylactery is intact, the demilich can't be permanently destroyed. Its skull reforms after 1d10 days, restoring the creature to its wretched state. If it has the presence of mind to do so, a demilich can reclaim its former power by feeding just one soul to its phylactery. Doing so restores the demilich to \Monster{lich} form, reconstituting its undead body.\subtitle{Undead Nature.} A demilich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. So great is a demilich's will to survive that it always has the maximum number of hit points for its Hit Dice, instead of average hit points.\title{A Demilich's Lair}A demilich hides its earthly remains and treasures in a labyrinthine tomb guarded by monsters and traps. At the heart of this labyrinth rests the demilich's skull and the dust from its other bones. In its crypt, a demilich has access to lair actions and additional uses for its legendary actions. Its whole lair also has unique traits. A demilich in its lair has a challenge rating of 20 (24,500 XP).\subtitle{Lair Actions} On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the demilich rolls a d20. On a result of 11 or higher, the demilich takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. It can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.\list{The tomb trembles violently for a moment. Each creature on the floor of the tomb must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.}{The demilich targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it.

Such creatures can't teleport into or out of the tomb's area or use planar travel to enter or leave it.

Monster Manual	WTC A921812:GenericBØ7Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the \Place{Abyss}, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil - engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.

\sub{Spawn of Chaos.} The \Place{Abyss} creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as \Monster{manes}) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the \Place{Abyss}.

\sub{Capricious Elevation.} Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon's status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.

A demon might spawn as a \Monster{manes}, then become a \Monster{dretch}, and eventually transform to a \Monster{vrock} after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the \Place{Abyss}. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the \Monster[demon lord]{demon lords} that threaten to tear the \Place{Abyss} apart with their endless warring.

By expending considerable magical power, \Monster[demon lord]{demon lords} can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon's deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a \Monster{demon lord} might warp a \Monster{manes} into a \Monster{quasit} when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of \Monster[dretch]{dretches} into \Monster[hezrou]{hezrous} when marching against a rival lord. \Monstger[demon lord]{Demon lords} only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.

\sub{Abyssal Invasions.} Wherever they wander across the \Place{Abyss}, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.

Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.

\sub{Signs of Corruption.} Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.

\sub{Eternal Evil.} Outside the \Place{Abyss}, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can't stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in commbat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor. It then instantly reforms in the \Place{Abyss}, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed. The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the \Place{Abyss} and kill it there.

\sub{Protected Essence.} A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon's abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.

Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holds - or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.

\sub{Demonic Cults.} Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. \Monster[demon lord]{Demon lords} manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the \Monster{demon lord}'s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the \Place{Abyss}.

\sub{Demon Summoning.} Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with \Monster[devil]{devils} fear the fiends of the \Place{Abyss}. Though demons yearn to sow chaos on the \Place{Material Plane}, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.

Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another's will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.

\sub{Bound Demons.} The \Item{Book of Vile Darkness}, the \Item{Black Scrolls of Ahm}, and the \Item{Demonomicon of Jggwilv} are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the \Place}Material Plane}, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend's return to the \Place{Abyss}.

An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.

\sub{Demonic Possession.} No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.

As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged  to the \Place{Abyss} with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.JhDemons are the embodiment of chaos and evil - engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form."

’Displacer Beast2!
Monster Manual	WTC A9218QQ:GenericB˜This monstrous predator takes its name from its ability to displace light so that it appears to be several feet away from its actual location. A displacer beast resembles a sleek great cat covered in blue-black fur. However, its otherworldly origins are clear in its six legs and the two tentacles sprouting from its shoulders, both ending in pads tipped with spiky protrusions. A dis placer beast's eyes glow with an awful' malevolence that persists even in death.

\em{\bold{Unseelie Origins.}} Displacer beasts roamed the twilight lands of the \Place{Feywild} for ages, until they were captured and trained by the \Group{Unseelie Court}. The warriors of the court selectively bred the beasts to reinforce their ferocious and predatory nature, using them to hunt \Monster[unicorn]{unicorns}, \Monster[pegasus]{pegasi}, and other wondrous prey. However, it didn't take long for the displacer beasts to use their malevolent intelligence to escape their masters.

Running and breeding freely in the \Place{Feywild}, the displacer beasts soon came to the attention of the \Group{Seelie Court}. With \Monster{blink dog} companions at their side, fey hunters drove these predators to the fringes of the \Place{Feywild}, where many crossed over to the \Place{Material Plane}. To this day, displacer beasts and \Monster[blink dog]{blink dogs} attack each other on sight.

\em{\bold{Love of the Kill.}} Displacer beasts kill not just for food but also for sport. They target prey even when not hungry, often toying with their victims to entertain themselves until they are ready to eat. After killing its prey using its tentacles, a displacer beast drags the corpse to a quiet place where it can feed without distraction.

Displacer beasts hunt alone or in small prides that demonstrate skill at setting ambushes. A single beast will strike and withdraw, luring prey into a densely wooded area where its packmates wait. Packs of displacer beasts hunting near trade roads recall the frequency and schedule of regular caravans, laying down ambushes to pick off those caravans.

\em{\bold{Prized Guards and Pets.}} Intelligent evil creatures favor displacer beasts as pets, but a displacer beast enters such an alliance only if it appears beneficial. A displacer beast might guard a vault or act as a bodyguard for a prominent individual.J"A tentacled, 6 legged black beast.rdisplacer beast.webp(08

Monster Manual	WTC A9218RR:GenericBáDoppelgangers are devious shapeshifters that take on the appearance of other humanoids, throwing off pursuit or luring victims to their doom with misdirection an.d disguise. Few creatures spread fear, suspicion, and deceit better than doppelgangers. Found in every land and culture, they can take on the guise of any individual of any race.

\bold{\em{Stealing Secrets.}} A doppelganger's adopted form allows it to blend into almost any group or community, but its transformation doesn't impart languages, mannerisms, memory, or personality. Doppelgangers often follow or capture creatures they intend to impersonate, studying them and probing their minds for secrets. A doppelganger can read a creature's surface thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature's name, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories. A doppelganger impersonating a specific creature as part of a long-term plot might keep its double alive and close at hand for weeks, probing the victim's mind daily to learn how to behave and speak authentically.

\bold{\em{Hedonistic Swindlers.}} Doppelgangers work alone or in small groups, with group roles shifting from con to con. While one doppelganger takes the place of a murdered merchant or noble, the others take on a number of identities as circumstances warrant, playing the parts of family or servants while they live off the victim's riches.

\bold{\em{Changelings.}} Doppelgangers are too lazy or selfinterested to raise their young. They assume attractive male forms and seduce women, leaving them to raise their progeny. A doppelganger child appears to be a normal member of its mother's species until it reaches adolescence, at which point it discovers its true nature and is driven to seek out its kind to join them.JWDoppelgangers are devious shapeshifters that take on the appearance of other humanoids.rdoppelganger.jpg"(8BJ (0bjŠ’<š

The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.

Monster Manual	WTC A9218VV:GenericB¤True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.

Many creatures, including \Monster{wyverns} and \Monster{dragon turtles}, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of \Monster[chromatic dragon]{chromatic} and \Monster{metallic dragons}. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.

Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.

True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.\title{Dragon Age Categories}\table[Category][Size][Age Range]{Wyrmling}{Medium}{5 years or less}{Young}{Large}{6-100 years}{Adult}{Huge}{101-800 years}{Ancient}{Gargantuan}{801 years or more}JjTrue dragons are powerful, ancient winged reptiles feared for their cunning, greed, and magical abilities.

Dragonborn2$
Player's Handbook	WTC A9217 !:GenericB›Born of \Monster{dragons}, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the \Monster{dragons} themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.\title{Proud Dragon Kin} Dragonborn look very much like \Monster{dragons} standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6 1/2 feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.

The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through som e dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestorâ€”bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.\title{Self-Sufficient Clans} To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonbornâ€™s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.

A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the  self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push them selves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect o f a dragonborn.

Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races â€” or even from the gods.JProud Dragonborn are born from \Monster{dragons} and strive to be self-sufficient.

±)DrowElf*Dark Elf2!
Monster Manual	WTC A9218~:GenericBÂ(Tens of thousands of years ago, the \Monster[elf]{elves} were divided, with those of benevolent disposition battling those that were selfish and cruel. The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves - the drow-found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.

\em{\bold{Children of Lolth.}} The drow worship \God{Lolth}, a deity who resides in the \Place{Abyss}. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do. The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.

\em{\bold{Creatures of Darkness.}} The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.

\em{\bold{Underdark Cities.}} The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resÂ·lient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings.

A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.

\em{\bold{Drow Magic.}} Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon \Monster[demon]{demons} from the \Place{Abyss}. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.

\em{\bold{Arms and Armor.}} Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.

\em{\bold{Cutthroat Politics.}} Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.

Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.

\em{\bold{Matriarchal Rule.}} \God{Lolth}, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the \Place{Material Plane} and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.

In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.

\em{\bold{Poison Predilection.}} Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the \Place{Underdark}, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.JThe dark cousins of the elves.r	drow.webp

ðDuergar2!
Monster Manual	WTC A9218zz:GenericBþThe tyrannical duergar, also known as gray dwarves, dwell in fantastic cities deep in the \Place{Underdark}. Using ancient dwarven knowledge and myriad slaves, they work tirelessly to expand their subterranean kingdoms.

Most duergar (including females) are bald and have ashen gray skin. They wear drab clothing designed to blend in with stone, along with simple jewelry that reflects their severe and utilitarian demeanor.

\em{\bold{Slaves to Slavers.}} The duergar were once \Monster[dwarf]{dwarves}, before their greed and endless delving beneath the earth brought them into contact with the mind flayers. Held in captivity for generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god \God{Laduguer}. Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth or artistry.

Duergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean races. They forge alliances when it is convenient, then break those alliances when they have nothing more to gain. They take and hold slaves to toil in the Underdark, regarding them as free labor and crude currency.

\em{\bold{Tough as Stone.}} Like dwarves, duergar have strong constitutions. Adding to their physical stamina is an incredible mental fortitude resulting from their time as slaves of the illithids. A duergar's mind is a fortress, able to shrug off charms, illusions, and other spells.

\em{\bold{Born of Darkness.}} The Underdark is saturated with strange magical power, which the duergar absorbed over generations of imprisonment. A duergar can increase its size and strength for a short time, becoming a powerful ogre-sized warrior. If it faces a foe it can't fight, or when spying on creatures approaching its territory, it can just as easily become invisible to slip away into the darkness.

Eons spent in the Underdark also sharpened their darkvision, allowing them to see twice as far as other dwarves. This keen eyesight comes at a cost, however, as a duergar's vision is compromised by sunlight.

\em{\bold{Infernal Master.}} \God{Asmodeus}, Lord of the Nine Hells, has been known to impersonate duergar gods in order to cultivate the evil brimming in the hearts of the gray dwarves. He offers them divine guidance and vengeance against their enemies while urging them on toward greater acts of tyranny, all the while concealing his true identity.J+Tyrannical dwarves living in the underdark.rduergar.jpg

Though little more than animated energy on their own planes of existence, they can be called on by spellcasters and powerful beings to take shape and perform tasks.

\sub{Living Elements.} On its home plane, an elemental is a bodiless life force. Its dim consciousness manifests as a physical shape only when focused by the power of magic. A wild spirit of elemental force has no desire except to course through the element of its native plane. Like beasts of the \Place{Material Plane}, these elemental spirits have no society or culture, and little sense of being.

\em{Conjured by Magic.} Certain spells and magic items can conjure an elemental, summoning it from the \Place[inner plane]{Inner Planes} to the \Place{Material Plane}. Elementals instinctively resent being pulled from their native planes and bound into service. A creature that summons an elemental must assert force of will to control it.

\em{Bound and Shaped.} Powerful magic can bind an elemental spirit into a material template that defines a specific use and function. \Monster[invisible stalker]{Invisible stalkers} are \Monster[air elemental]{air elementals} bound to a specific form, in the same way that \Monster[water elemental]{water elementals} can be shaped into \Monster[water weird]{water weirds}.

The strength of the magic and materials that bind an elemental determines how well the elemental functions in a bound form. \Monster[golem]{Golems} are elemental spirits bound to physical forms, but weaker materials such as flesh and clay can't bind elemental power sufficiently. Durable materials such as stone and iron require stronger magic, which consequently binds an elemental more securely.

\sub{Elemental Nature.} An elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.JY are incarnations of the elements that make up the universe: air, earth, fire, and water.

§Ettercap2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218ƒƒ:GenericB½Ettercaps are humanoid spiders that tend, feed, and watch over spiders the way a shepherd oversees a flock of sheep. They lair deep in remote forests.

Fine strands of silk stream from glands in an ettercap's abdomen, letting it shoot sticky strands of webbing to bind, entrap, or strangle its victims. It can also use its webbing to fashion elaborate snares and nets, which often festoon its lair.

\em{\bold{Quiet Killers.}} When travelers and explorers venture into an ettercap's territory, the ettercap stalks them. Some meet their end wandering blindly into traps or sections of forest enclosed by webs. Others, the ettercap garrotes with strands of web or envenoms with its poisonous bite.

\em{\bold{Sylvan Despoilers.}} Though they dwell in the wilds, ettercaps have no desire to live in harmony with nature. A forest infested with ettercaps transforms into a gloomy place, choked with webs and infested with giant spiders, giant insects, and other sinister predators. Creatures that wander too far into such a wood are soon lost in a maze of webs that dangle with the bones and lost treasures of the ettercaps' victims.

\em{\bold{Enemies of the Fey.}} Ettercaps are natural enemies of fey creatures. The foul creatures set web snares to catch \Monster[sprite]{sprites} and \Monster[pixie]{pixies}, which they hungrily devour, and will encase a \Monster{dryad}'s tree in webbing in a vain attempt to trap the dryad.

ÞEttin2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218„„:GenericBÂAn ettin is a foul, two-headed giant with the crude haracteristics of an \Monster{orc}. It never bathes if it can help it, and its thick skin is usually encrusted with a thick layer of dirt and grime beneath the stinking hides it wears. Its long stringy hair hangs in an unkempt mess about its faces, and its breath reeks from mouths filled with crooked teeth and tusks.\subtitle{Dual Personality.} The twin heads of an ettin are two individuals trapped in the same brutish body. Each head has its own mind, personality, and name, and possesses unique preferences and quirks. Bound from birth, both minds only rarely experience privacy or solitude. This familiarity breeds contempt, and an ettin bullies and argues with itself constantly, its two heads each taking constant offense at the other's slights.

When other creatures refer to an ettin, they combine its double names to form a single compound name that applies to the creature as a whole. If an ettin has one head named Hargle and another named Vargle, other creatures call the ettin Harglevargle.\subtitle{Solitary Lives.} As much as an ettin argues with itself, it is even less tolerant of other ettins, since a conversation between two ettins almost always amounts to a shouting match between a crowd of four belligerent heads. Most ettins are solitary creatures as a result, tolerating one another only to reproduce.

An ettin's twin heads are always the same gender, with a body to match. Females are the dominant gender among ettins, and they initiate the ettins' mating rituals. After finding a suitable den, a female ettin hunts and conquers a male, which cares for and feeds her during her six-month pregnancy. Once the child is born, the male ettin is released from servitude. When the child is old enough to hunt for itself, the mother sends it away and abandons the den.\subtitle{Two Heads are Better than One.} When focused on a mutually beneficial purpose or united by a common threat, an ettin can resolve its personality differences and dedicate itself fully to a task. An ettin fights with a weapon in each hand, making twin attacks directed by its respective heads. When an ettin sleeps, one of its heads remains ever alert, gaining its only moments of privacy and keeping two eyes open for any creature that disturbs its precious solitude.\subtitle{Orcish Ties.} In ancient dialects of Common, the word 'ettin' translates as 'ugly giant.' Legends tell of \Monster{orcs} that once stumbled upon a temple to \God{Demogorgon}, the magic of which transformed them into giant mockeries of the twin-headed Prince of Demons. Driven to near madness, these creatures scattered into the wilderness to become the first ettins.

Whatever the truth of the ettins' origin, \Monster{orcs} treat them as distant cousins, and \Monster{orc} tribes often entice ettins to serve as guards, scouts, and marauders. An ettin isn't particularly loyal to its \Monster{orc} handlers, but the \Monster{orcs} can win it over with the promise of food and loot.JWAn ettin is a foul, two-headed giant with the crude haracteristics of an \Monster{orc}.r	ettin.png	(	08

Flameskull2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218††:GenericBžBlazing green flames and mad, echoing laughter follow a disembodied skull as it patrols its demesne. When the undead flameskull discovers trespassers, it blasts the intruders with fiery rays from its eyes and dreadful spells called up from the dark recesses of its memory.

Dark spellcasters fashion flameskulls from the remains of dead wizards. When the ritual is complete, green flames erupt from the skull to complete its ghastly transformation.

\sub{LegacyofLife.} A flameskull only dimly recalls its former life. Though it might speak in its old voice and recount key events from its past, it is but an echo of its former self. However, its undead transformation grants it full access to the magic it wielded in life, letting it cast spells while ignoring the material and somatic components it can no longer employ.

\sub{Eternally Bound.} Intelligent and vigilant, a flameskull serves its creator by protecting a hidden treasure hoard, a secret chamber, or a specific individual. A flameskull carries out the directives given to it when it was created, and it interprets those commands to the letter. A flameskull's master must craft its instructions with care to ensure that the creature carries out its tasks properly.

\sub{Wreathed in Flame.} The fire wreathing a flameskull burns continually, giving off bright light that the creature controls. It uses those flames as a weapon, focusing them to loose them as fiery rays from its eye sockets.

\sub{Eldritch Rejuvenation.} A flameskull's shattered fragments reform unless they are splashed with holy water or subjected to a dispel magic or remove curse spell. If it can no longer fulfill its intended purpose, the re-formed flameskull is beholden to no one and becomes autonomous.

\sub{Undead Nature.} A flameskull doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.JeBlazing green flames and mad, echoing laughter follow a disembodied skull as it patrols its demesne. rflameskull.png(8	BB(J

Its brain is capable of simple reason, though its thoughts are no more sophisticated than those of a young child. The golem's muscle tissue responds to the power of lightning, invigorating the creature with vitality and strength. Powerful enchantments protect the golem's skin, deflecting spells and all but the most potent weapons.

A flesh golem lurches with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body. Its dead flesh isn't an ideal container for an elemental spirit, which sometimes howls incoherently to vent its outrage. If the spirit breaks free of its creator's will, the golem goes berserk until calmed, or until its shell of flesh is destroyed or completely healed.JŽA flesh golem is a grisly assortment of humanoid body parts stitched and bolted together into a muscled brute imbued with formidable strength.rflesh golem.jpeg(8BJ	

Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.

The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk.

Taking the place of plants in the subterranean realm, fungi are vital to the survival of many underground species, providing nourishment and shelter in the unforgiving darkness.

Fungi spawn in organic matter, then break that matter down to consume it, feeding on filth and corpses. As they mature, fungi eject spores that drift on the lightest breeze to spawn new fungi.

Not needing sunlight or warmth to grow, fungi thrive in every corner and crevice of the Underdark. Transformed by the magic that permeates that underground realm, Underdark fungi often develop potent defensive mechanisms or abilities of mimicry and attack.

A gargoyle lurks among masonry and ruins, as still as any stone sculpture, and delights in the terror it creates when it breaks from its suspended pose, as well as the pain it inflicts on its victims.

\em{\bold{Animate Stone.}} Gargoyles cling to rocky cliffs and mountains, or roost on ledges in underground caves. They haunt city rooftops, perching vulture-like among the high stone arches and buttresses of castles and cathedrals, and they can hold themselves so still that they appear inanimate. Able to maintain this state for years, a gargoyle makes an ideal sentry.

\em{\bold{Deadly Reputation.}} Gargoyles have a reputation for cruelty. Statues carved into the likenesses of gargoyles appear in the architecture of countless cultures to frighten away trespassers. Although such sculptures are only decorative, real gargoyles can hide among them to ambush unsuspecting victims. A gargoyle might alleviate the tedium of its watch by catching and tormenting birds or rodents, but its long wait only increases its craving for harming sentient creatures.

\em{\bold{Cruel Servants.}} Gargoyles are easily inspired by the cunning of an intelligent master. They enjoy simple tasks such as guarding a master's home, torturing and killing interlopers, and anything else that involves minimum effort and maximum pain and carnage.

Gargoyles sometimes serve demons for their propensity for wanton chaos and destruction. Powerful  spellcasters can also easily enlist gargoyle guardians to keep watch over their gates and walls. Gargoyles have the patience and fortitude of stone, and will serve even the cruelest master for years without complaint.

Monster Manual	WTC A9218‰Š:GenericBªThe first gas spores are thought to have been from dead \Monster[beholder]{beholders}, whose moldering corpses fed a parasitic fungus with aberrant magic. Having long since adapted into a unique plant creature, a gas spore grows quickly and purposefully out of any corpse, creating a malevolent-looking mockery of the most feared denizen of the Underdark.

\em{\bold{Eye Tyrant's Form.}} A gas spore is a spherical, balloon-like fungus that resembles a beholder from a distance, though its true nature becomes. increasingly obvious as one approaches it. The monster possesses a blind central 'eye' and rhizome growths sprouting from its upper surface, superficially resembling a beholder's eyestalks.

\em{\bold{Death Burst.}} A gas spore is a hollow shell filled with a lighter-than-air gas that enables it to float as a beholder does. Piercing the shell with even the weakest attack causes the creature to burst apart, releasing a cloud of deadly spores. A creature that inhales the spores becomes host to them, and is often dead within a day. Its corpse then becomes the spawning ground from which new gas spores arise.

\em{\bold{Beholder Memories.}} A gas spore that sprouts from a \Monster{beholder}'s corpse sometimes carries within it memories of its deceased parent. When the gas spore explodes, its deadly spores cast those memories adrift. Any creature that inhales the spores and survives inherits one or more of the beholder's fragmented memories, and might gain useful information about the beholder's former lair and other nearby places and creatures of interest.J5A floating plant that looks somewhat like a beholder.rgas spore.webp(8BB

Monster Manual	WTC A9218““:GenericBÎA ghost is the soul of a once-living creature, bound to haunt a specific location, creature, or object that held significance to it in its life.

\em{\bold{Unfinished Business.}} A ghost yearns to complete some unresolved task from its life. It might seek to avenge its own death, fulfill an oath, or relay a message to a loved one. A ghost might not realize that it has died and continue the everyday routine of its life. Others are driven by wickedness or spite, as with a ghost that refuses to rest until every member of a certain family or organization is dead.

The surest way to rid an area of a ghost is to resolve its unfinished business. A ghost can be destroyed more easily by invoking a weakness tied to its former life. The ghost of a person tortured to death might be killed again by the implements of that torture. The ghost of a gardener might become more vulnerable when exposed to a potent floral fragrance.

\em{\bold{Ghostly Manifestations.}} Sensations of profound sadness, loneliness, and unfulfilled yearning emanate from places where ghostly hauntings occur. Strange sounds or unnatural silences create an unsettling atmosphere. Cold spots settle in rooms that have roaring fires. A choking stench might seep into the area, inanimate objects might move of their own accord, and corpses might rise from the grave. The ghost has no control over these manifestations; they simply occur.

A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours.

Possession (Recharge 6)™One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

Ghouls roam the night in packs, driven by an insatiable hunger for humanoid flesh.\subtitle{Devourers of Flesh.}Like maggots or carrion beetles, ghouls thrive in places rank with decay and death. A ghoul haunts a place where it can gorge on dead flesh and decomposing organs. When it can't feed on the dead, it pursues living creatures and attempts to make corpses of them. Though they gain no nourishment from the corpses they devour, ghouls are driven by an unending hunger that compels them to consume. A ghoul's undead flesh never rots, and this monster can persist in a crypt or tomb for untold ages without feeding.\subtitle{Abyssal Origins.} Ghouls trace their origins to the \Place{Abyss}. \NPC{Doresain}, the first of their kind, was an \Monster{elf} worshiper of \God{Orcus}. Turning against his own people, he feasted on humanoid flesh to honor the Demon Prince of Undeath. As a reward for his service, Orcus transformed Doresain into the first ghoul. Doresain served Orcus faithfully in the Abyss, creating ghouls from the demon lord's other servants until an incursion by \God{Yeenoghu}, the demonic Gnoll Lord, robbed Doresain of his abyssal domain. When Orcus would not intervene on his behalf, Doresain turned to the elf gods for salvation, and they took pity on him and helped him escape certain destruction.

\em{\bold{Amoeboid Form.}} The gibbering mouther's body is an amorphous mass of mouths and eyes that propels itself by oozing forward, fastening several mouths to the ground and pulling its bulk behind. Though it moves slowly, it swims through water, mud, and quicksand with ease.

\em{\bold{Mouths of Madness.}} When a gibbering mouther senses prey, its mouths begin to murmur and chatter, each with a different voice: deep or shrill, wailing or ululating, crying out in agony or ecstasy. This cacophonous gibbering overcomes the senses of any creature that hears it, causing most to flee in terror. Others are overcome with madness or stand paralyzed, fixated on the horrific creature as it oozes forward to consume them.

\em{\bold{All-Consuming.}} Driven to devour any creature it can reach, a gibbering mouther flows over victims transfixed by its mad ranting, its multitudinous voices temporarily silenced as it gnaws and swallows living flesh . The monster liquefies stone with which it comes into contact, hindering creatures that overcome its gibbering and attempt to flee.

A gibbering mouther leaves nothing of its prey behind.

Packs of ordinary \Monster{hyenas} followed in his wake, scavenging the demon lord's kills. Those hyenas were transformed into the first gnolls, parading after \NPC{Yeenoghu} until he was banished back to the \Place{Abyss}. The gnolls then scattered across the face of the world, a dire reminder of demonic power.\subtitle{Nomadic Destroyers.} Gnolls are dangerous because they strike at random. They emerge from the wilderness, plunder and slaughter, then move elsewhere. They attack like a plague of locusts, pillaging settlements and leaving little behind but razed buildings, gnawed corpses, and befouled land. Gnolls choose easy targets for their raids. Armored warriors holed up in a fortified castle will survive a rampaging gnoll horde unscathed, even as the towns, villages, and farms that surround the castle are ablaze, their people slaughtered and devoured.

Gnolls rarely build permanent structures or craft anything of lasting value. They don't make weapons or armor, but scavenge such items from the corpses of their fallen victims, stringing ears, teeth, scalps, and other trophies from their foes onto their patchwork armor.\subtitle{Thirst for Blood.}No goodness or compassion resides in the heart of a gnoll. Like a demon, it lacks anything resembling a conscience, and can't be taught or coerced to put aside its destructive tendencies. The gnolls' frenzied bloodlust makes them an enemy to all, and when they lack a common foe, they fight among themselves. Even the most savage \Monster{orcs} avoid allying with gnolls.JrGnolls are savage, cannibalistic humanoids descended from hyenas that attack settlements and devour their victims.r	gnoll.png

Monster Manual	WTC A9218¥¦:GenericB£Goblins are small, black-hearted, selfish humanoids that lair in caves, abandoned mines, despoiled dungeons, and other dismal settings. Individually weak, goblins gather in large- sometimes overwhelming- numbers. They crave power and regularly abuse whatever authority they obtain.

\em{\bold{Goblinoids.}} Goblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. Their larger cousins, \Monster[hobgolin]{hobgoblins} and \Monster[bugbear]{bugbears}, like to bully goblins into submission. Goblins are lazy and undisciplined, making them poor servants, laborers, and guards.

\em{\bold{Malicious Glee.}} Motivated by greed and malice, goblins can't help but celebrate the few times they have the upper hand. They dance, caper with sheer joy when victory is theirs. Once their revels have ended, goblins delight in the torment of other creatures and embrace all manner of wickedness.

\em{\bold{Leaders and Followers.}} Goblins are ruled by the strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen (who is nothing more than a glorified goblin boss) rules hundreds of goblins, spread out among multiple lairs to ensure the tribe's survival. Goblin bosses are easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken over by \Monster{hobgoblin} warlords or \Monster{bugbear} chiefs.

\em{\bold{Challenging Lairs.}} Goblins festoon their lairs with alarms designed to signal the arrival of intruders. Those lairs are also riddled with narrow tunnels and bolt-holes that human-sized creatures can't navigate, but which goblins can crawl through with ease, allowing them to flee or to circle around and surprise their enemies.

\em{\bood{Rat Keepers and Wolf Riders.}} Goblins have an affinity for \Monsetr[rat]{rats} and \Monster[wolf]{wolves}, raising them to serve as companions and mounts, respectively. Like rats, goblins shun sunlight and sleep underground during the day. Like wolves, they are pack hunters, made bolder by their numbers. When they hunt from the backs of wolves, goblins use hit-and-run attacks.

\em{\bold{Worshipers of Maglubiyet.}} \God{Maglubiyet} the Mighty One, the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of adoration but fear. Goblins believe that when they die in battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron. This is a 'privilege' that most goblins dread, fearing the Mighty One's eternal tyranny even more than death.J‡Goblins are small, black-hearted, selfish humanoids that lair in caves, abandoned mines, despoiled dungeons, and other dismal settings.rgoblin.jpeg

ŒGolem2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218§§:GenericBÚGolems are made from humble materials - clay, flesh and bones, iron, or stone-but they possess astonishing power and durability. A golem has no ambitions, needs no sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. An unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator's orders, and it protects or attacks as that creator demands.

To create a golem, one requires a \Item{manual of golems} (see the Dungeon Master's Guide). The comprehensive illustrations and instructions in a manual detail the process for creating a golem of a particular type.

\sub{Elemental Spirit in Material Form.} The construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a golem's creator is the master of the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the work.

After constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the golem's creator infuses it with a spirit from the \Place{Elemental Plane of Earth}. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem's creator.

\sub{Ageless Guardians.} Golems can guard sacred sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent spells.

A golems can be created with a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.

\sub{Blind Obedience.} When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can't fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently - or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.

A golem can't think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can't be reasoned with or tricked with words.

\sub{Constructed Nature.} A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.JxAn unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator's orders, and it protects or attacks as that creator demands.

Monster Manual	WTC A9218_`:GenericB›9The most cunning and treacherous of true \Monster{dragons}, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.

A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.

A \Monsterr{wyrmling green dragon}'s thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.

A green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an \Monster{older green dragon} can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.\subtitle{Capricious Hunters.} A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is \Monster{elves}.

Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other \Monster{dragons}. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.

A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.

\subtitle{Manipulative Schemers.} A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creature is only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.

When manipulating other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with \Monster{dragons} of the same age and status.\subtitle{Conflict and Corruption.} Green dragons sometimes clash with other \Monster{dragons} over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch - sometimes for decades - for the chance to slay the other \Monster{dragon}, then claim its lair and hoard.

Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as \Monster{goblinoids}, \Monster{ettercaps}, \Monster{ettins}, \Monster{kobolds}, \Monster{orcs}, and \Monster{yuan-ti}. They also delight in corrupting and bending \Monster{elves} to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.\subtitle{Living Treasures.} A green dragon's favored treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.\title{A Green Dragon's Lair}The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with \Monster{black dragons} in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath. The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.

At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.\title{Lair Actions}On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\list{Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.}{A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.}{Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.J·Green dragons are cunning, manipulative forest dwellers who use trickery and fear to dominate their territory and hoard treasures, especially sentient creatures and beautiful objects.rgreen dragon.webp

áGrell2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218¬¬:GenericBØA grell resembles a bulbous floating brain with a wide, sharp beak. Its ten long tentacles are made of hundreds of ring-shaped muscles sheathed in tough fibrous hide. Sharp barbs line the tip each tentacle and inject paralytic venom. The grell can partially retract its barbs into its tentacles to handle or manipulate objects it doesn't want to pierce or tear.

Grells have no eyes and floats by means of a sort of levitation. They have keen hearing, however, and their skin is sensitive to vibrations and electrical fields, allowing them to detect the presence of creatures and objects in their immediate vicinity. The creature's ability to manipulate electricity to sense and move also allow it to absorb lightning without harm.

Although solitary by nature, grells sometimes gather in small groups called covens.

\sub{Floating Ambushers.} A grell prefers to ambush lone creatures or stragglers, hovering silently near the ceiling of a passage or cavern until a suitable target passes below, whereupon it descends quickly and wraps its tentacles around its prey. It then floats away to its lair with the paralyzed creature in its clutches.

\sub{Alien Devourers.} Grell are alien predators that group other creatures into three categories: edibles, inedibles, and Great Eaters (those rare creatures that might prey on a grell). Grells have no compunction about attacking creatures they classify as edible, including humanoids. They tend to avoid bigger creatures that they have little hope of carrying away.

A grell will sometimes allow adventurers to wage war on the other monstrous inhabitants of the dungeon complex it calls home, staying out of the adventurers' way as they dispose of larger threats while waiting for the right time to strike.JCA grell resembles a bulbous floating brain with a wide, sharp beak.r

Instead, they drag their rubbery bodies to places where creatures regularly pass, lurking out of sight amid rocky rubble  and debris, squeezing into burrows, holes, or crevices, climbing up to ledges, or coiling a round stalactites to drop on unwary prey. A grick consumes virtually anything that moves except for other gricks.

ÆGrimlock2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218¯¯:GenericBÔThe degenerate subterranean grimlocks were once human, but their worship of the \Monster{mind flayers} over generations of prowling the \Place{Underdark} transformed them into blind, monstrous cannibals long ago.\subtitle{Debased Cultists.} The empire of the \Monster{mind flayers} once spread across many worlds, enslaving countless races. Among those were human cultures whose high priests the \Monster{mind flayers} subverted using their insidious powers of thought control. Those leaders gradually turned the faiths of their followers toward the \Monster{illithids}, which they worshiped as blasphemous deities.

Over time, the rituals of these enslaved humans created fervent cannibal cults that regarded the brain eating of the \Monster{mind flayers} as a holy sacrament. The \Monster{illithids} commanded their worshipers to abduct other sentient creatures to be sacrificed. After the victims' brains had been consumed, the mind flayers gave the lifeless bodies to the cultists.\subtitle{Blind Hunters.} When the rule of the \Monster{mind flayers} crumbled, their cults faced constant warfare from their enemies, the same creatures that had once been their victims. The cults fled into the \Place{Underdark} domains of their \Monster{illithid} gods. Over generations in that lightless realm, the cultists learned to rely on their other senses for survival. In time, their eyes withered away and eyelids sealed, leaving only covered eye sockets behind.

A grimlock's ears prick up at the faintest footfall or whisper echoing down stone passageways. It can speak in tones too low for most other humanoids to hear. The odors of sweat, flesh, and blood awaken its hunger, and it can track by such scents like a bloodhound. To enhance their senses, grim locks leave trails of blood, piles of dung, or the viscera of slain prey in places far from their lairs. When intruders pass through those areas, they carry the foul scents with them, warning the grimlocks of their approach.

For most creatures, blindness is an enormous hindrance. For a grimlock with its other heightened senses, sightlessness is a boon. A grimlock isn't fooled by visual illusions or misperceptions. It is fearless as it stalks prey.\subtitle{Endless War.} Grimlocks still venerate the \Monster{mind flayers}, serving them whenever possible. Grimlocks also recall the war in which they were driven underground. To them, it has never ended. They continue to return to the surface world to abduct captives for their \Monster{illithid} masters.J'Degenerate, blind, monstrous cannibals.rgrimlock.png

Monster Manual	WTC A9218°°:GenericBÆ,Hags represent all that is evil and cruel. Though they resemble withered crones, there is nothing mortal about these monstrous creatures, whose forms reflect only the wickedness in their hearts.\subtitle{Faces of Evil.} Ancient beings with origins in the \Place{Feywild}, hags are cankers on the mortal world. Their withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair, horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long, skinny fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open flesh with a touch. Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy.

All hags possess magical powers, and some have an affinity for spellcasting. They can alter their forms or curse their foes, and their arrogance inspires them to view their magic as a challenge to the magic of the gods, whom they blaspheme at every opportunity.

Hags name themselves in darkly whimsical ways, claiming monikers such as Black Morwen, Peggy Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug, Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth. Monstrous Motherhood. Hags propagate by snatching and devouring human infants. After stealing a baby from its cradle or its mother's womb, the hag consumes the poor child. A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.

Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.\subtitle{Dark Bargains.} Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are pleased to sell.

Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something dear - especially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge gained through the bargain.\subtitle{A Foul Nature.} Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, suppurating flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might 'help' such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.

This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects of a hag's life. A hag might fly in a magical giant's skull, landing it on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might travel with a menagerie of monsters and slaves kept in cages, and disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.\subtitle{Dark Sorority.} Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag in existence. Hags don't like each other, but they abide by an ageless code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into another hag's territory, bring gifts when entering another hag's dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags - as long as the oath isn't given with the fingers crossed.\subtitle{Hag Covens.} When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.

A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.

\bold{Shared Spellcasting.} While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:

1st level (4 slots): \Spell{identify}, \Spell{ray of sickness}

2nd level (3 slots): \Spell{hold person}, \Spell{locate object}

3rd level (3 slots): \Spell{bestow curse}, \Spell{counterspell}, \Spell{lightning bolt}

4th level (3 slots): \Spell{phantasmal killer}, \Spell{polymorph}

5th level (2 slots): \Spell{contact other plane}, \Spell{scrying}

6th level (1 slot): \Spell{eyebite}

For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier.

\bold{Hag Eye.} A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.

A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.JZHags resemble withered crones, but there is nothing mortal about these monstrous creatures

Monster Manual	WTC A9218··:GenericBŠ	This construct possesses intelligence, the ability to reason and adjust its tactics, and an unswerving devotion to its maker that persists even after its maker's demise. Resembling an animated suit of empty plate armor, a helmed horror serves without ambition or emotion.

\sub{Magical Purpose.} Though it takes more magical resources to create a helmed horror than a lesser suit of \Monster{animated armor}, the helmed horror requires less direction and maintenance as it carries out its appointed tasks. A helmed horror follows its orders with complete loyalty, and is intelligent enough to understand the difference between an order's intent and its exact wording. Unlike many constructs, it seeks to fulfill the former rather than slavishly follow the latter.

\sub{Tactical Cunning.} A helmed horror fights with the cunning of a skilled warrior, taking to the air as it attacks weaker characters and spellcasters first. However, a helmed horror lacks the insight to change its environment, fortify it, or otherwise take active measures to improve its defensive position.

\sub{Constructed Nature.} A helmed horror doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.JTThis construct possesses intelligence, the ability to reason and adjust its tactics.rhelmed horror.webp(8BBJ

Monster Manual	WTC A9218º»:GenericBŠ&War horns sound, stones fly from catapults, and the thunder of a thousand booted feet echoes across the land as hobgoblins march to battle. Across the borderlands of civilization, settlements and settlers must contend with these aggressive humanoids, whose thirst for conquest is never satisfied.

Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, and hair ranging from dark red-brown to dark gray. Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as \Monster{humans}, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.\subtitle{Goblinoids.} Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller \Monster{goblins} and the ferocious \Monster{bugbears}.\subtitle{Martial Might.} A hobgoblin measures virtue by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.

Hobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other. military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.\subtitle{Military Legions.} Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the \Monster{goblins} that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.

As loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren't restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.\subtitle{Strategic Thinkers.} Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate \Monster{elves} and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.

Legions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including \Monster{goblins}, \Monster{bugbears}, \Monster{orcs}, evil \Monster{humans}, \Monster{ogres}, and \Monster{giants}.\subtitle{Beast Trainers.} Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use \Monster{oxen} and \Monster{horses} to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained \Monster{ravens}, and keep vicious \Monster{wolves} to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained \Monster{worgs} as steeds, in the same way that \Monster{goblins} ride \Monster{wolves}. Some tribes even keep carnivorous \Monster{apes} as fighting beasts.\subtitle{Conquer and Control.} Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategicallyy advantageous locations, which they then use as staging a reas to expand their territory.

Hobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don't take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.

Hobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.\subtitile{Legion of Maglubiyet.} Hobgoblins worship \God{Maglubiyet the Mighty One}, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don't fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of \Place{Acheron}.J*Large, organized and dangerous goblinoids.rhobgoblin.webp

Monster Manual	WTC A9218½½:GenericB“A fierce predator of the Underdark, the hook horror aggressively defends its hunting grounds. The subterranean caverns where these creatures dwell echo with the constant clacking and scraping of their hooks as they wend their way up cliffs and along cavern walls.

The monstrous hook horror has a head resembling a vulture's and the torso of an enormous beetle, with an exoskeleton studded by sharp, bony protuberances. It gains its name from its long, powerfully built arms and legs, which end in wickedly curved hooked claws.\subtitle{Echoes in the Dark.} Hook horrors communicate by striking their hooks against their exoskeletons or the stone surfaces around them. What sounds to others like random clacking noise is actually a complex language that only hook horrors understand, and which carries for miles through the echoing Underdark.\subtitle{Pack Predators.} The omnivorous hook horrors eat lichens, fungi, plants, and any creature they can catch. A hook horror's hooked limbs give it excellent purchase on rock surfaces, and these creatures use their climbing skills to ambush prey from above. They hunt in packs, working together against the largest and most dangerous opponents. If a battle goes poorly, a hook horror quickly climbs a cavern wall to flee.\subtitle{Dedicated Clans.} Hook horrors live in extended family groups or clans. Each clan is ruled by the eldest female, who typically places her mate in charge of the clan's hunters. Hook horrors lay eggs, which are clustered in a central, well-defended area of a clan's home caverns.J›Hook horrors are aggressive predators with vulture-like heads and beetle-like torsos, known for their hooked claws and defensive behavior in the Underdark.rhook horror.webp(08

Body Thief	The intellect devourer initiates an Intelligence contest with an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it. If it wins the contest, the intellect devourer magically consumes the target's brain, teleports into the target's skull, and takes control of the target's body. While inside a creature, the intellect devourer has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. The intellect devourer retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its understanding of Deep Speech, its telepathy, and its traits. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics. It knows everything the creature knew, including spells and languages.

If the host body drops to 0 hit points, the intellect devourer must leave it. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the body drives the intellect devourer out. The intellect devourer is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a \Spell{wish}. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the intellect devourer can voluntarily leave the body, teleporting to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The body then dies, unless its brain is restored within 1 round.

Monster Manual	WTC A9218ÀÀ:GenericBêAn invisible stalker is an \Monster{air elemental} that has been summoned from its native plane and transformed by powerful magic. Its sole purpose is to hunt down creatures and retrieve objects for its summoner. When it is defeated or the magic that binds it expires, an invisible stalker vanishes in a gust of wind.\subtitle{Directed Hunter.} When an invisible stalker is created, it stays at its summoner's side until it is given a task to perform. If an assignment doesn't involve hunting down and slaying a specific creature or recovering an object, the magic that created the invisible stalker ends and the elemental is released. Otherwise, it completes the task, then returns to its summoner for more commands, forced to serve until the magic that binds it expires. If its summoner dies in the interim, the invisible stalker vanishes after completing its task.

An invisible sta lker is an unwilling servant at best. It resents any undertaking assigned to it. A mission that requires significant time might drive the invisible stalker to pervert the intent of a command unless it is worded carefully.\subtitle{Unseen Threat.} Invisible stalkers are composed of air  and are naturally invisible. A creature might hear and feel an invisible stalker in passing, but the elemental remains invisible even when it attacks. A spell that allows someone to see the invisible reveals only the invisible stalker's vague outline.\subtitle{Elemental Nature.} An invisible stalker requires no air, food , drink, or sleep.JÄInvisible stalkers are air elementals that are summoned and bound by magic to hunt down and retrieve objects for their summoner.

A few years ago, Jalester left the \Place{Dales} and traveled to \Place{Waterdeep} with several other members of the company, one of whom - \NPC{Faerrel Dunblade} - would become his best friend and lover.

The wizard \NPC{Elminster} befriended the two young men and brought them to the attention of \NPC{Laeral Silverhand}, who put them to work as deputies and spies. Jalester and Faerrel helped the Open Lord expose a plot to overhrow the government, but Faerrel was killed while helping bring the perpetrators to justice. Jalester remained in Waterdeep afterward, becoming one of Laeral's field operatives in the service of Waterdeep and the Lords' Alliance. He has been romantically unattached ever since Faerrel's death but longs again for love.

Waterdeep - Dragon Heist	WTC C4658ÎÎ:GenericBÍJarlaxle is a flamboyant, swashbuckling drow iconoclast. He leads a renegade \Monster{drow} faction called \Group{Bregan D'aerthe}, made up of disenfranchised male drow, most of them culled from destroyed or disgraced houses. Gifted with a sharp mind, a sense of humor, puissant s kill with a blade, and a wealth of useful magic items, Jarlaxle infiltrated the city of Luskan, brought a kind of order to its lawlessness, and declared himself its secret lord.

Jarlaxle likes to weave a tangled web of schemes that leave his enemies baffled - the latest of which is a plan to legitimize Luskan by making it a member of the Lords' Alliance. The city's unsavory reputation has thwarted all previous efforts, and the current leaders of the Lords' Alliance have voiced their opposition to Luskan's admittance. A few have flatly declared that the city will never be welcome in the alliance. Nonetheless, Jarlaxle aims to persuade \NPC{Laeral Silverhand}, the Open Lord of \Place{Waterdeep}, to champion Luskan's cause even if that means losing other alliance members in the process. Tying \Place{Luskan}'s fortunes to those of \Place{Waterdeep} would increase Jarlaxle's political and economic power on the \Place{Sword Coast}.

Jarlaxle has come to \Place{Waterdeep} in the guise of an llluskan human named \NPC{Zardoz Zord}. 'Captain Zord' is the master of the \Group{Sea Maidens Faire}, a carnival that travels up and down the Sword Coast in three ships: the \em{Eyecatcher}. the \em{Heartbreaker}, and the \em{Hellraiser} (all words that describejarlaxle). He spends most of his time aboard the Eyecatcher, his personal ship. The other two vessels carry members of the carnival and their parade wagons.

Jarlaxle has forged an alliance with \Place{Lantan} (an island to the south), and has armed his \Group{Bregan D'aerthe} lieutenants with Lantanese firearms that rely on magical smokepowder to function. He has also acquired a Lantanese submarine called the \em{Scarlet Marpenoth}. This underwater vessel is mounted below the \em{Eyecatcher} and kept out of sight. Jarlaxle plans on using the submarine to flee \Place{Waterdeep} if his scheme unravels.

Jarlaxle's loyalties are to himself first and foremost, and to \Group{Bregan D'aerthe} secondarily.J8Jarlaxle is a flamboyant, swashbuckling drow iconoclast.R(The AC of Suave Defense is not included.R8Rapier is not listed and does not include magical bonus.rjarlaxle baenre.webp(8BJ (0PZbj’xš

Monster Manual	WTC A9218ÂÂ:GenericB¹Kenku are feathered humanoids that wander the world as vagabonds, driven by greed. They can perfectly imitate any sound they hear.\subtitle{Fallen Flocks.} Kenku wear ill-fitting cloaks, robes, and rags. These garments cover the soft, sleek feathers of their bodies, shrouding their bare arms and legs. They tread lightly when they walk, on talons made for grasping the branches of trees and seizing prey from the lofty skies. Soft as the wind they move, so as not to draw attention to their shameful forms.

Once, the kenku held the wind in their wings, embracing the gusty sky and singing the sweet language of birdsong. Serving a master whose identity is now lost to their memory, the kenku coveted the glittering baubles of his household, and longed to speak so that they could cajole and swindle others out of such treasures. Stealing the secret of speech from a volume in their master's library, they disguised themselves in rags to beg for pretty things. When their master learned of their greed, he stripped away their wings as punishment, forcing them to beg forever.\subtitle{Speech in Pantomime.} Kenku can mimic the sound of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might make the sound of coins clinking together, and a kenku referring to a busy marketplace can reproduce the cacophony of hawking vendors, barking dogs, bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When mimicking voices, they can only repeat words and phrases they have heard, not create new sentences. To converse with a kenku is to witness a performance of imitated sounds and almost nonsensical verse.

Kenku speak to one another in much the same way. Because they are adept at interpreting one another's glances and gestures, the sounds they make to communicate complex ideas or emotions can be succinct. Groups of kenku also develop secret codes. For example, a eat's meow might be the secret code for 'Prepare to attack!' or 'Flee for your lives!'

Their talent for mimicry extends to handwriting, and criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge documents. When a kenku commits a crime, it might forge evidence to implicate another creature.\subtitle{The Wistful Wingless.} All kenku pine for the ability to fly, and thus the punishments they mete out to one another often involve false wings, such as heavy wings of wood borne as a mark of shame. As a final, tragic reminder of the wings they once had, kenku carry out executions by hurling their condemned from tall buildings or cliffs.JRKenku are feathered humanoids that wander the world as vagabonds, driven by greed.r

Monster Manual	WTC A9218ÃÃ:GenericBŒKobolds are craven reptilian humanoids that worship evil \Monster[dragon]{dragons} as demigods and serve them as minions and toadies. Kobolds inhabit dragons' lairs when they can but more commonly infest dungeons, gathering treasures and trinkets to add to their own tiny hoards.

\em{\bold{Strength in Numbers.}} Kobolds are egg-laying creatures. They mature quickly and can live to be 'great wyrms' more than a century old. However, many kobolds perish before they reach the end of their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey for predators. This vulnerability forces them to band together. Their superior numbers can win battles against powerful adversaries, but often with massive casualties on the kobold side.

\em{\bold{Tunnelers and Builders.}} Kobolds make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making and tunneling. Their lairs consist of low tunnels through which they move easily but which hinder larger humanoids. Kobolds also riddle their lairs with traps. The most insidious kobold traps make use of natural hazards and other creatures. A trip wire might connect to a spring-loaded trap that hurls clay pots of flesh-eating \Monster{green slime} or flings crates of venomous \Monsetr[giant centipede]{giant centipedes} at intruders.

\em{\bold{The Lost God.}} In addition to the \Monster[dragon]{dragons} they revere, kobolds worship a lesser god named \God{Kurtulmak}. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as \God{Tiamat}'s vassal in the \Place{Nine Hells} until \God{Garl Glittergold}, the god of \Monster[gnome]{gnomes}, stole a trinket from the Dragorn Queen's hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket, but Garl Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak's most devoted worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-maze.

\em{\bold{Winged Kobolds.}} A few kobolds are born with leathery wings and can fly. Known as \Monster[winged kobold]{urds}, they like to lurk on high ledges and drop rocks on passersby. Although the urds' wings are seen as gifts from Tiamat, the Dragon Queen, wingless kobolds are envious of those gifts and don't get along with the urds.JsKobolds are craven reptilian humanoids that worship evil dragons as demigods and serve them as minions and toadies.rkobold.jpeg

ÉKuo-toa2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218ÆÇ:GenericB•Kuo-toa are degenerate fishlike humanoids that once inhabited the shores and islands of the surface world. Long ago \Monster{humans} and their ilk drove the kuo-toa underground, where they dwell in madness and everlasting night. Kuo-toa can no longer abide daylight.

 \sub{Mad Slaves.} At the height of the \Monster{illithid} empire; the \Monster[mind flayer]{mind flayers} captured kuo-toa by the thousands and forced them into bondage. The kuo-toa were simple creatures, never meant to endure the oppressive mental force the \Monster[illithid]{illithids} unleashed against them. By the time the \Monster[mind flayer]{mind flayers} abandoned them, the prolonged psychic subjugation endured by the kuo-toa had driven them mad.

Their minds shattered beyond repair, the kuo-toa adopted a religious fervor, inventing gods to protect them against threats. Most notable of these threats are the \Monster{drow}, which have slain the kuo-toa on sight since the days when the two races first met.

\sub{God Makers.} Kuo-toa worship gods of their own insane creation, but if enough kuo-toa believe that a god is real, the energy of their collective subconscious can cause that god to manifest as a physical entity. The form a kuo-toa god takes depends on the inspiration for its divine image, and is usually random or nonsensical.

One of the most revered gods of the kuo-toa is \God{Blibdoolpoolp} the Sea Mother, who takes the form of a female \Monster{human} with a crayfish head, a crayfish's claws, and an articulated shell covering her shoulders. \God{Blibdoolpoolp} was likely invented by a kuo-toa that improved on a broken \Monster{human} statue by adding the limbs and head of a crustacean. In sudden awe of its handiwork, it then named the resulting form a god.

Kuo-toa that cross paths with an \Monster{aboleth} often find themselves worshiping it as a god, their madness blinding them to the fact that the \Monster{aboleth} is merely using them for its own nefarious ends.

\sub{Theocratic Rulers.} \Monster[kuo-toa archpriest]{Kuo-toa archpriests} are surrounded by fanatical devotees of their faith. The \Monster[kuo-toa archpriest]{archpriest} of a kuo-toa domain demands that all its subjects worship a specific god. An \Monster[kuo-toa archpriest]{archpriest's} mad belief in its god is so fervent that it manifests the powers of a high cleric. The \Monster[kuo-toa archpriest]{archpriest} can also bestow spells to devout underlings called \Monster[kuo-toa whip]{whips}. One or more of these \Monster[kuo-toa whip]{whips} are also the \Monster[kuo-toa archpriest]{archpriest}'s children, and their primary role in kuo-toan society is to fight to the death to claim the throne when the \Monster[kuo-toa archpriest]{archpriest} dies. If a \Monster[kuo-toa whip]{whip} displeases the \Monster[kuo-toa archpriest]{archpriest}, the \Monster[kuo-toa archpriest]{archpriest} can strip it of its spell casting ability, if not its life.

The \Monster[kuo-toa archpriest]{archpriest}'s decrees are enforced by monitors, devout kuo-toa that act as the \Monster[kuo-toa archpriest]{archpriest}'s eyes and ears. Monitors are deadly hand-to-hand combatants, and lesser kuo-toa live in fear of them.

\sub{Kuo-toa Gear.} Many weapons of the kuo-toa are designed to capture rather than kill. Nets are common, though some carry pincer staffs (also called mancatchers) designed to trap and immobilize foes. Kuo-toa warriors also treat their shields with a sticky goo that catches incoming weapons.

In general, kuo-toa don't like the weight of armor on their slippery bodies and rely on their natural rubbery hides for protection. However, they like to wear jewelry made from scavenged bones, shells, pearls, gems, and carapace fragments.JjKuo-toa are degenerate fishlike humanoids that once inhabited the shores and islands of the surface world.rkuo-toa.webp

If possessing a host they appear as humans in dim light and are often mistaken for \Monster{adherers} or \Monster{mummies} in brighter light.\title{Combat} All raggamoffyns attempt to envelop potential victims in order to control them. If successful, the parts of the raggamoffyn cling to the victim in a skin-tight sheath from head to toe. The raggamoffyn usually creat a hood to cover the victim's face as well. Once enveloped, a victim is forced to do the raggamoffyn's bidding until the creature is done with them or they are able to resist the creature's control.\title{Society}These creatures can not speak but they understand the Common tongue. All raggamoffyns are driven to create more of their kind, but a host is required to do so. The host is enveloped and forced to destroy magic items while the raggamoffyn performs a silent rite that mysteriously creates a new raggamoffyn. The host is usually not directly harmed during this process, though the raggamoffyn often forces them to commit crimes in order to attain magic items, the result of which could lead to the hosts getting harmed.

Because the shadow of death doesn't hang over them, they can conceive plans that take years, decades, or centuries to come to fruition.

A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh stretched tight across its bones. Its eyes succumbed to decay long ago, but points of light burn in its empty sockets. It is often garbed in the moldering remains of fine clothing and jewelry worn and dulled by the passage of time.\subtitle{Secrets of Undeath.} No wizard takes up the path to lichdom on a whim, and the process of becoming a lich is a well-guarded secret. Wizards that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul entities. Many turn to \NPC{Orcus}, Demon Prince of Undeath, whose power has created countless liches. However, those that control the power of lichdom always demand fealty and service for their knowledge.

A lich is created by an arcane ritual that traps the wizard's soul within a phylactery. Doing so binds the soul to the mortal world, preventing it from traveling to the \Place{Outer Planes} after death. A phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver.

With its phylactery prepared, the future lich drinks a potion of transformation - a vile concoction of poison mixed with the blood of a sentient creature whose soul is sacrificed to the phylactery. The wizard falls dead, then rises as a lich as its soul is drawn into the phylactery, where it forever remains. Soul Sacrifices. A lich must periodically feed souls to its phylactery to sustain the magic preserving its body and consciousness. It does this using the \Spell{imprisonment} spell. Instead of choosing one of the normal options of the spell, the lich uses the spell to magically trap the target's body and soul inside its phylactery. The phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for the spell to work. A lich's phylactery can hold only one creature at a time, and a \Spell{dispel magic} cast as a 9th-level spell upon the phylactery releases any creature imprisoned within it. A creature imprisoned in the phylactery for 24 hours is consumed and destroyed utterly, whereupon nothing short of divine intervention can restore it to life.

A lich that fails or forgets to maintain its body with sacrificed souls begins to physically fall apart, and might eventually become a \Monster{demilich}.\subtitle{Death and Restoration.} When a lich's body is broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of the lich drains from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse behind. Within days, a new body reforms next to the lich's phylactery, coalescing out of glowing smoke that issues from the device. Because the destruction of its phylactery means the possibility of eternal death, a lich usually keeps its phylactery in a hidden, well-guarded location.

Destroying a lich's phylactery is no easy task and often requires a special ritual, item, or weapon. Every phylactery is unique, and discovering the key to its destruction can be a quest in and of itself.\subtitle{Lonely Existence.} From time to time, a lich might be stirred from its single-minded pursuit of power to take an interest in the world around it, most often when some great event reminds it of the life it once led. It otherwise lives in isolation, engaging only with those creatures whose service helps secure its lair.

Few liches call themselves by their former names, instead adopting monikers such as the Black Hand or the Forgotten King.\subtitle{Magic Collectors.} Liches collect spells and magic items. In addition to its spell repertoire, a lich has ready access to potions, scrolls, libraries of spell books, one or more wands, and perhaps a staff or two. It has no qualms about putting these treasures to use whenever its lair comes under attack.\subtitle{Undead Nature.} A lich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\title{A Lich's Lair} A lich often haunts the abode it favored in life, such as a lonely tower, a haunted ruin, or an academy of black magic. Alternatively, some liches construct secret tombs filled with powerful guardians and traps.

Everything about a lich's lair reflects its keen mind and wicked cunning, including the magic and mundane traps that secure it. Undead, constructs, and bound demons lurk in shadowy recesses, emerging to destroy those who dare to disturb the lich's work.

A lich encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 22 (41,000 XP).\subtitle{Lair Actions}

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lich can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the lich can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\list{The lich rolls a d8 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.}{The lich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A crackling cord of negative energy tethers the lich to the target. Whenever the lich takes damage, the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the lich takes half the damage (rounded down), and the target takes the remaining damage. This tether lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round or until the lich or the target is no longer in the lich's lair.}{The lich calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in its lair. These apparitions materialize and attack one creature that the lich can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. The apparitions then disappear.}JœLiches are powerful undead wizards who seek eternal life through dark magic.

Lizardfolk2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218ÌÌ:GenericBíLizardfolk are primitive reptilian humanoids that lurk in the swamps and jungles of the world. Their hut villages thrive in forbidding grottos, half-sunken ruins, and watery caverns.\subtitle{Territorial Xenophobes.} Lizardfolk deal and trade with other races only rarely. Fiercely territorial, they use camouflaged scouts to guard the perimeter of their domain. When unwelcome visitors are detected, a tribe sends a hunting band to harass or drive the trespassers off, or tricks them into blundering into the lairs of crocodiles and other dangerous creatures.

Lizardfolk have no notion of traditional morality, and they find the concepts of good and evil utterly alien. Truly neutral creatures, they kill when it is expedient and do whatever it takes to survive.

Lizardfolk rarely stray beyond their claimed hunting grounds. Any creature that enters their territory is fair game to be stalked, killed, and devoured. They make no distinction between humanoids, beasts, and monsters. Similarly, lizardfolk don't like reaching too far beyond their borders, where they could easily become the hunted instead of the hunters.

Occasions might arise when lizard folk will form alliances with their neighbors. These lizardfolk usually learn firsthand that \Monster{humans}, \Monster{dwarves}, \Monster{halflings}, and \Monster{elves} can sometimes prove helpful or trustworthy. Once lizardfolk forge ties with outsiders, they are steadfast and fierce allies.\subtitle{Great Feasts and Sacrifices.} Lizardfolk are omnivorous, but they have a taste for humanoid flesh. Prisoners are often taken back to their camps to become the centerpieces of great feasts and rites involving dancing, storytelling, and ritual combat. Victims are either cooked and eaten by the tribe, or are sacrificed to \God{Semuanya}, the lizardfolk god.\subtitle{Canny Grafters.} Though they aren't skilled artisans, lizardfolk craft tools and ornamental jewelry out of the bones of their kills, and they use the hides and shells of dead monsters to create shields.\subtitle{Lizardfolk Leaders.} Lizardfolk respect and fear magic with a religious awe. Lizardfolk shamans lead their tribes, overseeing rites and ceremonies performed to honor \God{Semuanya}. From time to time, however, a lizardfolk tribe produces a powerful figure touched not by Semuanya but by \NPC{Sess'inek} - a reptilian \Monster{demon lord} who seeks to corrupt and control the lizardfolk.

Lizard folk born in \NPC{Sess'inek}'s image are larger and more cunning than other lizardfolk, and are thoroughly evil. These lizard kings and queens dominate lizardfolk tribes, usurping a shaman's authority and inspiring uncharacteristic aggression among their subjects.\subtitle{Dragon Worshipers.} Lizardfolk speak Draconic, which they are thought to have learned from \Monster{dragons} in ancient times. A tribe that wanders into the territory of a \Monster{dragon} will offer it tribute to win its favor. An evil \Monster{dragon} might exploit lizardfolk for its own vile ends, turning them into raiders and plunderers.J^Lizardfolk are primitive reptilian humanoids that lurk in the swamps and jungles of the world.rlizardfolk.webp

‘Lycanthrope2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218ÎÎ:GenericB…One of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire , features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.

Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and towns.\subtitle{Curse of Lycanthropy.} A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes. A \Spell{remove curse} spell can rid an afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a \Spell{wish}.

A lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form - or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.

Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.JLLycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast.

The original \NPC{Manshoon} was one of the founders of the \Group{Zhentarim}. Evil to the core, he made enemies all across  \Place{FaertÃ»n}, including other powerful spellcasters such as \NPC{Khelben Arunsun} and \NPC{Elminster}. Fearing that he might be destroyed by his foes, \NPC{Manshoon} magically crafted several clones - but a mishap caused all of them to be awakened at once, whereupon they tried to destroy one another in a series of conflicts that came to be known as the \Event{Manshoon Wars}.

Now the original \NPC{Manshoon} is dead, and it's widely believed that all his clones were destroyed as well. In fact, at least three are still alive. The one presently in \Place{Waterdeep} escaped death by hiding out in \Place{Undermountain}, where he eventually ran afoul of \NPC{Halaster Blackcloak}. After a brief spell duel, \NPC{Halaster} captured \NPC{Manshoon} and amputated his left arm at the elbow for reasons unknown. \NPC{Manshoon} escaped imprisonment and fled \Place{Undermountain}, taking refuge in the city above. Attempts to magically regenerate his severed limb failed, forcing him to craft an artificial arm and hand for himself.

\NPC{Manshoon} took control of \Place{Kolat Towers}, a crumbling residence in the \Place{Southern Ward} that was abandoned years ago by the two wizards who built it. The edifice is surrounded by a magical barrier that has the properties of a wall of force. \NPC{Manshoon} rarely leaves the towers and uses a teleportation circle when he must do so, and thus is never seen entering or leaving. \NPC{Manshoon} aims to rule \Place{Waterdeep} and replace the \Group{City Watch} with \Group{Black Network} mercenaries that are loyal to him alone. By bribing and blackmailing the \Group{Masked Lords}, he hopes to oust \NPC{Laeral Silverhand} as \NPC{Open Lord} and take her place, kill the \NPC{Blackstaff}, reduce the \Group{Masked Lords} to mere vassals, and declare himself the Wizard-King of \Place{Waterdeep}. Once the city is firmly in his clutches, Manshoon will then turn his attention toward \Place{Undermountain}, destroy \NPC{Halaster} once and for all, and claim the dungeon's riches.J"A clone of the ancient archwizard.rmanshoon.png

Monster Manual	WTC A9218ÕÕ:GenericB™A monster in every sense of the word, a manticore has a vaguely humanoid head, the body of a lion, and the wings of a dragon. A bristling mane stretches down the creature's back, and its long tail ends in a cluster of deadly spikes that can impale prey at impressive range.\em{\bold{Evil Predators.} Manticores are fierce killers that hunt far and wide for prey. They work together to take down particularly large or dangerous creatures, sharing the meal once a kill is made. A manticore begins its attack with a volley of tail spikes, then lands and uses its claws and bite. When outdoors and outnumbered, it uses its wings to stay aloft, attacking from a distance until its spikes are depleted.

A manticore isn't particularly bright, but it possesses a malevolent nature and the ability to converse. In the course of attacking, it denigrates its foes and offers to kill them swiftly if they beg for their lives. If a manticore sees an advantage to be gained by sparing a creature's life, it does so, asking for a tribute or sacrifice equal to its loss of food.

\em{\bold{Monstrous Relationships.}} Manticores serve wicked masters that treat them well and provide regular prey. A manticore might provide aerial support for an \Monster{orc} horde or a \Monster{hobgoblin} army. Another could serve as a hunting companion for a \Monster{hill giant} chief, or guard the entrance to a \Monster{lamia}'s lair.

The manticores' greatest territorial rivals include \Monster{chimeras}, \Monster{griffons}, \Monster{perytons}, and \Monster{wyverns}. Manticores hunting as a pack often have the advantage of greater numbers. In addition to these creatures, manticores fear dragons and avoid them.J.A mix of human and lion and wings of a dragon.rmanticore.jpeg(08BB2J (0’<š

They lurk in quiet exile among the tumbled ruins of their former lives, surrounded by the petrified remains of past admirers and would-be heroes.\subtitle{Immortal Splendor.} Men and women who desire eternal youth, beauty, and adoration might pray to malicious gods, beg \Monster{dragons} for ancient magic, or seek out powerful archmages to fulfill their wishes. Others make sacrifices to demon lords or archdevils, offering all in exchange for this gift, oblivious to the curse that accompanies it. Those who strike such bargains gain physical beauty, restored youth, immortality, and the adoration of all who behold them, granting them the influence and power they so desire. However, after years of the living like a demigod among mortals, the price for their vanity and hubris is exacted, and they are forever transformed into medusas. A medusa's hair turns into a nest of venomous serpents, and all who gaze upon the medusa are petrified, becoming stone monuments to its corruption.\subtitle{Medusa Laiils.} Medusas live forever in seclusion, alienated from the world around them by their mon~trous form and caprice. Their homes gradually fall into disrepair until they are little more than shadowy ruins covered with thorns and creepers, riddled with obstructions and hiding places. Foolhardy looter and adventurers who enter are often unaware of the medusa's presence until the creature is among them.

A medusa is subject to its own curse. By looking vainly on its reflection, it turns to stone as surely as any living mortal. As a result, a medusa destroys or removes any mirrors or reflective surfaces in its lair.JìAs a result of their vanity and a curse, medusas are immortal beings that live in seclusion, surrounded by the petrified remains of their admirers.

Petrifying GazeÛWhen a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the \Spell{greater restoration} spell or other magic.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.²1

Mimics are shapeshifting predators able to take on the form of inanimate objects to lure creatures to their doom. In dungeons, these cunning creatures most often take the form of doors and chests, having learned that such forms attract a steady stream of prey.

\bold{\em{Imitative Predators.}} Mimics can alter their outward texture to resemble wood, stone, and other basic materials, and they have evolved to assume the appearance of objects that other creatures are likely to come into contact with. A mimic in its altered form is nearly unrecognizable until potential prey blunders into its reach, whereupon the monster sprouts pseudopods and attacks.

When it changes shape, a \Monster{mimic} excretes an adhesive that helps it seize prey and weapons that touch it. The adhesive is absorbed when the mimic assumes its amorphous form and on parts the mimic uses to move itself.

\bold{\em{Cunning Hunters.}} \Monster[mimic]{Mimics} live and hunt alone, though they occasionally share their feeding grounds with other creatures. Although most mimics have only predatory intelligence, a rare few evolve greater cunning and the ability to carry on simple conversations in Common or Undercommon.

´Mind Flayer*Illithid2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218ÝÞ:GenericBôMind flayers, also called illithids, are the scourge of sentient creatures across countless worlds. Psionic tyrants, slavers, and interdimensional voyagers, they are insidious masterminds that harvest entire races for their own twisted ends. Four tentacles snake from their octopus-like heads, flexing in hungry anticipation when sentient creatures come near.

In eons past, illithids controlled empires that spanned many worlds. They subjugated and consequently warped whole races of humanoid slaves, including the \Monster{githyanki} and \Monster{githzerai}, the \Monster[grimlock]{grimlocks}, and the \Monster{kuo-toa}. Conjoined by a collective consciousness, the illithids hatch plots as far-reaching and evil as their fathomless minds can conceive.

Since the fall of their empires, illithid collectives on the \Place{Material Plane} have resided in the \Place{Underdark}.

\sub{Psionic Commanders.} Mind fiayers possess psionic powers that enable them to control the minds of creatures such as \Monster[troglodyte]{troglodytes}, \Monster[grimlock]{grimlocks}, \Monster[quaggoth]{quaggoths}, and \Monster[ogre]{ogres}. Illithids prefer to communicate via telepathy and use their telepathy when issuing commands to their thralls.

When an illithid meets strong resistance, it avoids initial combat as it orders its thralls to attack. Like physical extensions of the illithid's thoughts, these thralls interpose themselves between the mind fiayer and its foes, sacrificing their lives so that their master can escape.

\sub{Hive Mind Colonies.} Solitary mind flayers are likely rogues and outcasts. Most illithids belong to a colony of sibling mind flayers devoted to an \Monster{elder brain} - a massive brain-like being that resides in a briny pool near the center of a mind fiayer community. From its pool, an \Monster{elder brain} telepathically dictates its desires to each individual mind flayer within 5 miles of it, for it is able to hold multiple mental conversations at once.

\sub{Hunger of the Mind.} Illithids subsist on the brains of humanoids. The brains provide enzymes, hormones, and psychic energy necessary for their survival. An illithid healthy from a brain-rich diet secretes a thin glaze of mucus that coats its mauve skin.

An illithid experiences euphoria as it devours the brain of a humanoid, along with its memories, personality, and innermost fears. Mind flayers will sometimes harvest a brain rather than devour it, using it as part of some alien experiment or transforming it into an \Monster{intellect devourer}.JdMind flayers, also called illithids, are the scourge of sentient creatures across countless worlds. rmind flayer.webp(8BJ (0PZb’xš

Monster Manual	WTC A9218ßß:GenericB§A \Monster{minotaur}'s roar is a savage battle cry that most civilized creatures fear. Born into the mortal realm by demonic rites, minotaurs are savage conquerors and carnivores that live for the hunt. Their brown or black fur is stained with the blood of fallen foes, and they carry the stench of death.

\bold{\em{The Beast Within.}} Most minotaurs are solitary carnivores that roam labyrinthine dungeons, twisting caves, primeval woods, and the maze-like streets and passages of desolate ruins. A minotaur can visualize every route it might take to close the distance to its prey.

The scent of blood, the tearing of flesh, and the cracking of bones spur a minotaur's lust for carnage, overwhelming all thought and reason. In a blood rage, a minotaur charges anything it sees, butting and goring like a battering ram, then chopping the fallen in twain.

Apart from ambushing creatures that wander into its labyrinth, a minotaur cares little for strategy or tactics. Minotaurs seldom organize, they don't respect authority or hierarchy, and they are notoriously difficult to enslave, let alone control.

\bold{\em{Cults of the Horned King.}} Minotaurs are the dark descendants of humanoids transformed by the rituals of cults that reject the oppression of authority by returning to nature. Inductees often mistake these cults for druidic circles or totemic religions whose ceremonies involve entering a labyrinth while wearing a ceremonial animal mask.

Within these bounded environments, cultists hunt, kill, and eat wild beasts, indulging their basest primal urges. In the end, however, sacrificial animals are exchanged for humanoid sacrifice - sometimes an inductee that tried to escape the cult after learning its secrets. These labyrinths become blood-soaked halls of slaughter, echoing to the cultists' savagery.

Unknown to all but their highest-ranking leaders, these mystery cults are creations of the demon lord \NPC{Baphomet}, the Horned King, whose layer of the \Place{Abyss} is a gigantic labyrinth. Some of his followers are fervent supplicants that plead for strength and power. Others come to the cult seeking a life free from authority's chains - and are liberated of their humanity instead as \NPC{Baphomet} transforms them into the minotaurs that echo his own savage form.

Although they begin as creations of the Horned King, minotaurs can breed true with one another, giving rise to an independent race of Baphomet's savage children in the world.J8Savage conquerors and carnivores that live for the hunt.rminotaur.webp(	08	B(J (0	j’<š

©Mummy2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218ãä:GenericB¬Raised by dark funerary rituals, a mummy shambles from the shrouded stillness of a time-lost temple or tomb. Having been awoken from its rest, it punishes transgressors with the power of its unholy curse.

\em{\bold{Preserved Wrath.}} The long burial rituals that accompany a mummy's entombment help protect its body from rot. In the embalming process, the newly dead creature's organs are removed and placed in special jars, and its corpse is treated with preserving oils, herbs, and wrappings. After the body has been prepared, the corpse is typically wrapped in linen bandages.

\em{\bold{The Will of Dark Gods.}} An undead mummy is created when the priest of a death god or other dark deity ritually imbues a prepared corpse with necromantic magic. The mummy's linen wrappings are inscribed with necromantic markings before the burial ritual concludes with an invocation to darkness. As a mummy endures in undeath, it animates in response to conditions specified by the ritual. Most commonly, a transgression against its tomb, treasures, lands, or former loved ones will cause a mummy to rise.

\em{\bold{The Punished.}} Once deceased, an individual has no say in whether or not its body is made into a mummy. Some mummies were powerful individuals who displeased a high priest or pharaoh, or who committed crimes of treason, adultery, or murder. As punishment, they were cursed with eternal undeath, embalmed, mummified, and sealed away. Other times, mummies acting as tomb guardians are created from slaves put to death specifically to serve a greater purpose.

\em{\bold{Creature of Ritual.}} A mummy obeys the conditions and parameters laid down by the rituals that created it, driven only to punish transgressors. The overwhelming terror that foreshadows a mummy's attack can leave the intended victim paralyzed with fright. In the days following a mummy's touch, a victim's body rots from the outside in, until nothing but dust remains.

\em{\bold{Ending a Mummy's Curse.}} Rare magic can undo or dispel the ritual that gave rise to a mummy, allowing it to truly die. More commonly, a mummy can be sent back to its endless rest by undoing the transgression that caused it to rise. A sacred idol might be replaced in its niche, a stolen treasure could be returned to its tomb, or a temple might be purified of despoiling bloodshed.

More ephemeral or permanent offenses, such as revealing a secret the mummy wished kept or killing an individual the mummy loved, can't be so easily remedied. In such cases, a mummy might slaughter all the creatures responsible and still not sate its wrath.

\em{\bold{Undead Archives.}} Though they seldom bother to do so, mummies can speak. As a result, some serve as undead repositories of lost lore, and can be consulted by the descendants of those who created them. Powerful individuals sometimes intentionally sequester mummies away for occasional consultation.

\em{\bold{Undead Nature.}} A mummy doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.J7A mummy is an embalmed that that still shambles around.r

ÔOoze2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218ðð:GenericBüOozes thrive in the dark, shunning areas of bright light and extreme temperatures. They flow through the damp underground, feeding on any creature or object that can be dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping from walls and ceilings, spreading across the edges of underground pools, and squeezing through cracks. The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze's presence is often the searing pain of its acidic touch.

Oozes are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know that an immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign that an ooze lairs nearby.\Subtitle{Slow Death.} An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim's comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.

Since not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its killers.\subtitle{Unwitting Servants.} Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.\subtitle{Spawn of \NPC{Juiblex}.} According to the \Item{Demonomicon of Jggwilv} and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord \NPC{Juiblex}. Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent. \subtitle{Ooze Nature.} An ooze doesn't require sleep.JAn amorphous mass of a monster.

Monster Manual	WTC A9218ôö:GenericBß!Orcs are savage raiders and pillagers with stooped postures, low foreheads, and piggish faces with prominent lower canines that resemble tusks.

\sub{Gruumsh One-Eye.} Orcs worship \God{Gruumsh}, the mightiest of the orc deities and their creator. The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When \God{Gruumsh} claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the \Monster[dwarf]{dwarves}. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the \Monster[elf]{elves}. Each place that \God{Gruumsh} wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at \God{Gruumsh}, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty \Item{spear}, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on \Monster[human]{humans}, \Monster[elf]{elves}, \Monster[dwarf]{dwarves}, and other folk.

Orcs hold a particular hatred for \Monster[elf]{elves}. The elven god \God{Corellon Larethian} half-blinded \God{Gruumsh} with a well-placed arrow to the ore god's eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering \Monster[elf]{elves}. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, \God{Gruumsh} grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.

\sub{Tribes like Plagues.} Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.

\sub{Ranging Scavengers.} Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats arid trenches.

When an existing territory is depleted of food, an ore tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.

On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside tosate their appetites.

\sub{Leadership and Might.} Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered ore tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod over other ore tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.

Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome \Monster[ogre]{ogres}, \Monster[troll]{trolls}, \Monster[half-orc]{half-orcs}, and \Monster[orog]{orogs} into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil \Monster[giant]{giants}, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.

\sub{Ore Crossbreeds.} \God{Luthic}, the ore goddess of fertility and wife of \God{Gruumsh}, demands that orcs procreate often and indiscriminately so that ore hordes swell generation after generation. The orcs' drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a \Monster{human} or a \Monster{dwarf}), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an \Monster{ogre}, the child is a \Monster{half-ogre} of intimidating strength and brutish features called an \Monster{ogrillon}.JOrcs are savage raiders and pillagers with stooped postures, low foreheads, and piggish faces with prominent lower canines that resemble tusks.rorc.webp

Like \God{Luthic}, orogs prefer to live underground, although the scarcity of food often brings them to the surface to hunt. \Monster[orc]{Orcs} respect an orog's strength and cunning, and a lone orog might command an \Monster{orc} war band.

\sub{Stronger and Smarter.} An orog uses its strength to bully other \Monster[orc]{orcs} and its intelligence to surprise enemies on the battlefield. Many an overconfident \Monster{elf}, \Monster{human}, or \Monster{dwarf} commander has watched a 'simple' \Monster{orc} warlord execute a clever maneuver to outflank and destroy an opposing force, not realizing the \Monster{orc} is an orog.

When encountered in great numbers, orogs form their own detachments within much larger \Monster{orc} hordes, and they are always at the forefront of any attack, relying on their superior strength and tactical insight to overcome anything that stands in their way.

Few \Monster{orc} tribes actively seek out orogs to bolster their ranks. The orogs' superiority makes them ideal leaders, and thus deadly rivals to \Monster{orc} war chiefs, who must be wary of orog treachery.

\sub{Detached Killers.} Wanting nothing more than to hack their enemies to pieces, orogs are a terrifying presence on the battlefield. They form no attachments, even to their parents and siblings, and have no concept of love or dedication. They worship the \Group{orc pantheon} of gods - \God{Gruumsh} and \God{Luthic} foremost - because they believe that the gods have strength beyond reason, and physical might is all they respect.

\suib{Servants of Darkness.} Mistrusted by \Monster[orc]{orcs}, some orogs form independent mercenary war bands that sell themselves to the highest bidder.

Orond is the patriarch, but he's not a quick-think-ing or cultured sort - and deep down, he knows it. He leaves most of the plotting and socializing to his wife, \NPC{Yalah}, to whom he is devoted.

When several of the \Group{Masked Lords} were assassinated in quick succession some years ago. Lord Gralhund had expected his wife to fill one of the vacancies. That never happened, though, despite many promises and bribes. After she was passed over, Orond became insanely angry, and he has remained that way ever since.

Less than a year ago, the Gralhunds were approached by agents of the \Group{Zhentarim} loyal lo \NPC{Manshoon}, and the nobles formed an alliance with them. House Gralhund gives the Zhents coin and allows them to use the family's noble villa as a refuge. In exchange, the house reaps all the benefits that the Black Network offers, including intelligence that its spies have gathered. So while the Zhents use House Gralhund as a shield, the Gralhunds are using the Zhenls to ascertain the identities and weaknesses of the Masked Lords.

Orond doesn't fully grasp how entwined the Black Network and his family have become it is now next to impossible to separate one from the other. lfs no secret in Waterdeep that the Black Network has firmly rooted itself in House Gralhund. But what's not generally known is thal the Zhents in House Gralhund are agents of Manshoon. Neither Orond nor any other member of his family knows about the wizard's clone. As far as Orond and his wife are concerned, the local leaders of the Black Network (with \NPC{Urstul Floxin} chief among them) reside with them in the family villa.

Orond is a short, stocky man who dresses well and is easy on the eyes. When he opens his mouth, his boorish nature, inflated sense of self-importance, fragile ego, and despicable opinions about 'the common rabble' come to the fore, and his charm quickly dissipates. When not in his wife's company, he is prone to excessive boasting and temper tantrums. When he must speak to strangers, he keeps his half-orc bodyguard \NPC{Hrabbaz} close by, for fear that others might attack and rob him at any moment. While in Yalah's presence, Orond becomes an altogether different person: quiet, almost timid, and happy to let his wife have the spotlight.

Orond relies on Yalah to manage the Zhentarim. He spends his days watching mercenaries train, paying bills, and ranting about the cost of doing business in the city. Although he is human, Orond was born with a tiefling's tail. The tail was amputated when he was a young boy, but the scar on his backside remains.J¦House Gralhund, a power-hungry noble family, uses the Zhentarim criminal network to gain intel on rivals while being unknowingly manipulated by a hidden Zhent leader.rorond gralhund.jpg(J	š

Monster Manual	WTC A9218øø:GenericB‹An otyugh is a grotesque, bulbous creature borne along on three sturdy legs, its eyes and nose set along a vine like stalk that snakes from the top of its bloated body. Two rubbery tentacles end in spiky, leaf-like appendages that the otyugh uses to shovel food into its gaping maw.

An otyugh buries itself under mounds of offal and carrion, leaving only its sensory stalk exposed. When an edible creature happens by, the otyugh's tentacles erupt from the filth and grab hold of it.

Otyughs make the most of any opportunity to ambush and devour prey. They use a limited form of telepathy to Â· urge sentient creatures toward their lairs, sometimes by pretending to be something else.\subtitle{Dwellers in Darkness.} Otyughs tolerate bright light only when considerable stores of carrion or garbage lie within reach. In the wilderness, they dwell in stagnant swamps, scum-filled ponds, and damp forest dells. The scent of graveyards, city sewers, village middens, and manure-filled animal pens attracts them to civilized areas.

Since otyughs lack concern for anything but food, their nests sometimes accumulate a variety of treasures shed from their victims and mixed among the junk.\subtitle{Symbiotic Guardians.} Sentient subterranean beings can coexist with otyughs, employing them as garbage disposals. With such plentiful sustenance, otyughs grow fat in their wallows, unmoved by any other drive or desire. This sedentary gluttony makes them reliable guardians.

ÖOwlbear2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218ùù:GenericBÑAn owlbear's screech echoes through dark valleys and benighted forests, piercing the quiet night to announce the death of its prey. Feathers cover the thick, shaggy coat of its bearlike body, and the limpid pupils of its great round eyes stare furiously from its owlish head.

\em{\bold{Deadly Ferocity.}} The owlbear's reputation for ferocity, aggression, stubbornnes, and sheer ill temper makes it one of the most feared predators of the wild. There is little, if anything, that a hungry owlbear fears. Even monsters that outmatch an owlbear in size and strength avoid tangling with it, for this creature cares nothing about a foe's superior strength as it attacks without provocation.

\em{\bold{Consummate Predators.}} An owl bear emerges from its den around sunset and hunts into the darkest hours of the night, hooting or screeching to declare its territory, to search for a mate, or to flush prey into its hunting grounds. These are typically forests familiar to the owlbear, and dense enough to limit its quarry's escape routes.

An owlbear makes its den in a cave or ruin littered with the bones of its prey. It drags partially devoured kills back to its den, storing portions of the carcass among the surrounding rocks, bushes, and trees. The scent of blood and rotting flesh hangs heavy near an owlbear's lair, attracting scavengers and thus luring more prey.

Owl bears hunt alone or in mated pairs. If quarry is plentiful, a family of owlbears might remain together for longer than 'is required to rear offspring. Otherwise, they part ways as soon as the young are ready to hunt.

\em{\bold{Savage Companions.}} Although they are more intelligent than most animals, owlbears are difficult to tame. However, with enough time, food, and luck, an intelligent creature can train an owlbear to recognize it as a master, making it an unflinching guard or a fast and hardy mount. People of remote frontier settlements have even succeeded at racing owlbears, but spectators bet as often on which owl bear will attack its handler as they do on which will reach the finish line first.

\Monster[elf]{Elven} communities encourage owlbears to den beneath their treetop villages, using the beasts as a natural defense during the night. \Monster{Hobgoblins} favor owlbears as war beasts, and \Monster{hill giants} and \Monster{frost giants} sometimes keep owl bears as pets. A starved owlbear might show up in a gladiatorial arena, ruthlessly eviscerating and devouring its foes before a bloodthirsty audience.

\em{\bold{Owlbear Origins.}} Scholars have long debated the origins of the owl bear. The most common theory is that a demented wizard created the first specimen by crossing a giant owl with a bear. However, venerable \Monster[elf]{elves} claim to have known these creatures for thousands of years, and some \Monster{fey} insist that owl bears have always existed in the \Place{Feywild}.J;Feathers cover the thick, shaggy coat of its bearlike body.rowlbear.webp(08B(J (0b¢ªm

A piercer is the larval form of a roper, and the two creatures often attack in tandem. A rock-like shell encases a piercer's body, giving it the look and texture of a stalactite. That shell protects a soft, slug-like upper body that lets the piercer move across cavern walls and ceilings to position itself for prey. With its eye and mouth closed, the piercer is difficult to distinguish from ordinary rock formations.\subtitle{Patient Hunters.} Piercers can see, but they can also respond to noise and heat, waiting for living creatures to pass beneath them, then falling to attack. A piercer that misses its chance to kill must make its slow way back to the ceiling. A fallen piercer excretes a foul-smelling slime when attacked, making most predators think twice about eating it.

Piercers gather in colonies to maximize the effectiveness of their attacks, dropping simultaneously to increase the odds of striking prey. After a piercer successfully slays a creature, the others slowly creep toward the corpse to join in the feast.J¸Clinging to the ceilings of caverns and large subterranean passages, piercers blend in perfectly with natural rock, dropping in silence to impale unsuspecting foes on the ground below.rpiercer.jpg(08BBJ

With its red-brown scales, horns, and a maw filled with sharp teeth, a pseudodragon resembles a tiny red dragon but its disposition is playful.\subtitle{Quiet and Defensive.} Pseudodragons have little interest in other creatures, and they avoid them whenever possible. If it is attacked, a pseudodragon fights back using the poisonous stinger at the tip of its tail, one jab of which can put a creature into a catatonic state that can last for hours.\subtitle{Draconic Familiars.} Mages often seek out pseudodragons, whose agreeable disposition, telepathic ability, and resistance to magic make them superior familiars. Pseudodragons are selective when it comes to choosing companions, but they can sometimes be won over with gifts of food or treasure. When a pseudodragon finds an agreeable companion, it bonds with that person as long as it is treated fairly. A pseudodragon puts up with no ill treatment, and it abandons a manipulative or abusive companion without warning.\subtitle{Language of Emotion.} Pseudodragons can't speak, but they communicate using a limited form of telepathy that allows them to share basic ideas such as hunger, curiosity, or affection. When it bonds with a companion, a pseudodragon can communicate what it sees and hears even over long distances.

A pseudodragon often vocalizes animal noises. A rasping purr indicates pleasure, while a hiss means unpleasant surprise. A bird-like chirping represents desire, and a growl always means anger or discontent.J¤Pseudodragons are elusive creatures that resemble tiny red dragons and make good familiars for mages due to their agreeableness, telepathy, and resistance to magic.rpseudodragon.png(08BB<J (

In a distant age, quaggoth tribes dwelled upon the surface as nocturnal arboreal hunters, possessing their own language and culture . When \Monster{elves} appeared in the mortal realm, they clashed with the quaggoths, eventually driving them to near extinction. Only by fleeing deep into the \Place{Underdark} did the quaggoths survive.

As they passed the ages deep beneath the world, the quaggoths' fur lost its color and their vision adapted to the darkness, even as the constant danger and weird magic of their new realm transformed them. Turning increasingly brutal and savage, they ate whatever food they could find - and when they could not find it, they preyed on each other. As cannibalism became part of their culture, their past was abandoned.\subtitle{Servants of the Drow.} The ancient enmity between quaggoths and surface \Monster{elves} makes them easy converts to the \Monster{dark elf} cause.

A thonot that fails the tribe is slain and devoured in a cannibalistic ritual, in the hope that its power passes to another more worthy quaggoth.\subtitle{Poison Immunity.} Generations of hunting venomous subterranean creatures and perpetual exposure to the molds and fungi that grow in the depths have forced quaggoths to adapt immunities to poisons of all kinds.JDSavage and territorial, quaggoths climb the chasms of the Underdark.rquaggoth.webp

Red Dragon2!
Monster Manual	WTC A9218cc:GenericBúThe most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures.

The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.

The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs. \subtitle{Mountain Masters.} Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hilldwelling copper dragons from time to time.\subtitle{Arrogant Tyrants.} Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archet'ypical evil dragon by many cultures.

No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragon kind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.\subtitle{Status and Slaves.} Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.

When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.\subtitle{Obsessive Collectors.} Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.

A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.JA red colored chromatic dragon.rred dragon.webp(

A humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process.

If the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated.

It claws its way back into the world to seek revenge against the one who wronged it. The revenant reclaims its mortal body and superficially resembles a zombie. However, instead of lifeless eyes, a revenant's eyes burn with resolve and flare in the presence of its adversary. If the revenant's original body was destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, the spirit of the revenant enters another humanoid corpse. Regardless of the body the revenant uses as a vessel, its adversary always recognizes the revenant for what it truly is.\subtitle{Hunger for Revenge.} A revenant has only one year to exact revenge. When its adversary dies, or if the revenant fails to kill its adversary before its time runs out, it crumbles to dust and its soul fades into the afterlife. If its foe is too powerful for the revenant to destroy on its own, it seeks worthy allies to help it fulfill its quest.\subtitle{Divine Justice.} No magic can hide a creature pursued by a revenant, which always knows the direction and distance between it and the target of its vengeance. In cases where the revenant seeks revenge against more than one adversary, it pursues them one at a time, starting with the creature that dealt it the killing blow.

 A roper has the appearance of a stalagmite or stalactite, which often allows it to attack with surprise. The creature can move slowly using thousands of sticky cilia beneath its base. It creeps up cave walls and along stone ceilings, finding the best position from which to attack.\subtitle{Underdark Hunters.} The roper is an evolved, mature form of \Monster{piercer}, with which it shares its rocklike appearance and hunting tactics. A roper can hold still for long hours, shutting its single eye to look like nothing more than a mundane formation of rock. Creatures that come too close are surprised when that eye snaps open and sticky tendrils shoot out to seize them. The roper then makes horrible guttural sounds as it reels in its struggling victims, drawing them close for the fatal bite of its stony teeth.

A roper can digest anything it eats with the exception of platinum, gemstones, and magic items, which can sometimes be retrieved from the creature's gizzard after death. A roper's digestive juices are also valuable, fetching a high price from alchemists who use them as a solvent.\subtitle{Weakening Tendrils.} A roper has six nubs set along its body, through which it extrudes sticky tendrils that bond to whatever they touch. Each tendril sends out hair-like growths that penetrate a creature's flesh and sap its strength, so the victim can struggle only weakly as the roper reels it in.

These strange, normally docile creatures corrode ferrous metals, then gobble up the rust they create. In doing so, they have ruined the armor, shields, and weapons of countless adventurers.

A rust monster's body is covered in thick, lumpy armor, its long tail ends in a bony protrusion, and two feathery antennae sprout from its insectile head.

\sub{Underground Scavengers.} Rust monsters roam subterranean passages in search of ferrous metals such as iron, steel, adamantine, and mithral to consume. They ignore creatures not carrying such metals, but can become aggressive toward those bearing steel weapons and armor. A rust monster can smell its food at a distance, immediately dashing toward the scent's source to corrode and consume the object.

A rust monster doesn't care if the rust it consumes comes from a spike or a sword. Adventurers can distract the creature by dropping ferrous objects behind them.

\sub{Subterranean Wanderers.} Rust monsters are rarely found in large numbers, preferring to hunt alone or in small groups. They meander along tunnels, moving from cave to cave in their tireless search for ferrous metals to consume. Their wanderings often bring them into contact with other \Place{Underdark} denizens that find them harmless or unappetizing. Thus, rust monsters may be found in close proximity to other subterranean monsters. If they are well treated and well fed, they can also become friendly companions or pets.JšA rust monster's body is covered in thick, lumpy armor, its long tail ends in a bony protrusion, and two feathery antennae sprout from its insectile head.rrust monster.jpeg(08B(J (0’<¢ªi

Monster Manual	WTC A9218‡‡:GenericBùAcross fog-shrouded coasts or endless ocean swells, an ominous drone sounded on a conch shell chills the blood of all who hear it. This is the sound of the sahuagin hunting horn - a call to raid and battle. Coastal settlers refer to sahuagin as 'sea devils', for sahuagin have no compassion in them, slaughtering the crews of ships and decimating coastal villages.\subtitle{Devils of the Deep.} Sahuagin are a predatory, piscine race that ventures from the ocean's black depths to hunt the creatures of the shallows and shore. Though they dwell in the deepest trenches of the ocean, sahuagin view the entire aquatic realm as their kingdom and the creatures in it as blood sport for their hunting parties.

The self-styled rulers of sahuagin ocean domains are massive mutant males that grow second sets of arms. They are terriblcy foes in battle, and all sahuagin bow down before these powerful barons.\subtitle{Way of the Shark.} Sahuagin worship the shark god \God{Sekolah}. Only female sahuagin are deemed worthy of channeling the god's power, and priestesses hold tremendous sway in sahuagin communities.

Sahuagin are driven into a frenzy by the smell of fresh blood. As worshipers of \God{Sekolah}, they also have a special kinship with \Monster{sharks}, which they train as attack animals. Even untrained \Monster{sharks} recognize sahuagin as allies and don't prey on them.\subtitle{Elven Enmity.} The sahuagin might control the oceans if not for the presence of their mortal enemies, the \Monster{aquatic elves}. Wars between the two races have raged for centuries across the coasts and seas of the world, disrupting maritime trade and drawing other races into the bloody conflict.

So intense is sahuagin hatred for the \Monster{aquatic elves} that the sea devils have adapted to combat their ancient foes. A sahuagin born near enough to an aquatic elf community can enter the world as a \Monster{malenti} - a sahuagin that physically resembles an aquatic elf in every way. Sahuagin are prone to mutation, but whether this rare phenomenon is a result of the wars between the sahuagin and the \Monster{aquatic elves} - or whether it preceded or even began the conflict - none can say.

The sahuagin put the \Monster{malenti} to good use as spies and assassins in \Monster{aquatic elf} cities and the societies of oher creatures that pose a threat to sahuagin. The mere shadow of the \Monster{malenti} threat incites paranoia and suspicion among \Monster{aquatic elves}, whose resilience is weakened as the prelude to an actual sahuagin invasion.JôSahuagin are a predatory race that worships the shark god \God{Sekolah} and are at constant war with the \Monster{aquatic elves}.

Some shadow dragons embrace the \Place{Shadowfell} for its bleak landscapes and desolation. Others seek to return to the \Place{Material Plane}, hungry to spread the darkness and evil of the \Place{Plane of Shadow}.\subtitle{Dark Portals.} Portals to the \Place{Shadowfell} manifest in forlorn places and the deep gloom of subterranean caverns. The dragons that lair in such places often discover these portals and find themselves transported to a new realm. Ancient \Monster{dragons} that sleep in their lairs for months or years at a time might find themselves spirited away, never knowing that a portal has formed without their knowledge as they dream.\subtitle{Recast in Shadow.} The transformation to a shadow dragon happens over a period of years, during which time a \Monnster{dragon}'s scales lose their luster and fade to a charcoal hue. Its leathery wings become translucent, its eyes paling to pools of opalescent gray. Shadow dragons find sunlight abhorrent, and they are weaker in bright light than they are in darkness. Darkness makes the dragon fade to a spectral shadow of its former self. The magical nature of \Monster{dragons} holds an attraction for the \Monster{Shadowfell}, which seems somehow to crave the might and majesty of these great reptiles. The \Monster{Shadowfell} also has a dispiriting effect on its denizens, such that the longer a creature remains on the plane, the more it accepts the plane's malaise. As months and years pass for a \Monster{dragon} on the \Place{Shadowfell}, it becomes aware of the transformation being wrought upon it, and yet can do nothing to prevent it.\subtitle{Back in the World.} A shadow dragon is so suffused with the power of the \Place{Shadowfell} that even a return to the \Place{Material Plane} can't undo its transformation. Some shadow dragons attempt to lure other creatures from the mortal realm back to the \Place{Shadowfell} to keep them company, at least until they tire of their guests and devour them. Others are happy to leave the \Place{Shadowfell} behind forever, understanding that treasure and power are easier to come by in the \Place{Material Plane}.\title{Shadow Dragon Template} Only a true \Monster{dragon} can transform into a shadow dragon, and only if it is born in the \Monster{Shadowfell} or remains there for several years. A \Monster{dracolich} can't be turned into a shadow dragon, since it loses its draconic nature when it becomes undead.

\em{\bold{Dark Disposition.}} From the darkness, the shadow reaches out to feed on living creatures' vitality. They can consume any living creature, but they are especially drawn to creatures untainted by evil. A creature that lives a life of goodness and piety consigns its basest impulses and strongest temptations to the darkness where the shadows hunger. As a shadow drains its victim's strength and physical form, the victim's shadow darkens and begins to move of its own volition. In death, the creature's shadow breaks free, becoming a new undead shadow hungry for more life to consume.

If a creature from which a shadow has been created somehow returns to life, its undead shadow senses the return. The shadow might seek its 'parent' to  vex or slay. Whether the shadow pursues its living counterpart, the creature that birthed the shadow no longer casts one until the monster is destroyed.

çShield Guardian2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218:GenericB£Wizards and other spell casters create shield guardians for protection. A shield guardian treads beside its master, absorbing damage to keep its master alive as long as possible.\subtitle{Master's Amulet.} Every shield guardian has an amulet magically linked to it. A shield guardian can have only one corresponding amulet, and if that amulet is destroyed, the shield guardian is incapacitated until a replacement amulet is created. A shield guardian's amulet is subject to direct attack if it isn't being worn or carried. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components.

A shield guardian's solitary focus is to protect the amulet's wearer. The amulet's wearer can command the guardian to attack its enemies or to guard the wielder against attack. If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance.

A spell caster can store a single spell within a shield guardian, which can then cast the spell on command or under specific conditions. Many a wizard has been Tendered helpless by enemies, only to surprise those foes when its shield guardian unleashes potent magical power.\subtitle{Magnificent Treasure.} Because a shield guardian's ownership can be transferred by giving its matching amulet to another creature, some wizards collect exorbitant sums from princes, nobles, and crime lords to create shield guardians for them. At the same time, a shield guardian makes a mighty prize for anyone who slays its master and claims its amulet.\subtitle{Construct Nature.} A shield guardian doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.JjA shield guardian treads beside its master, absorbing damage to keep its master alive as long as possible.rshield guardian.webp(08BJ

Spell Storing–A spellcaster who wears the shield guardian's amulet can cause the guardian to store one spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, the wearer must cast the spell on the guardian. The spell has no effect but is stored within the guardian. When commanded to do so by the wearer or when a situation arises that was predefined by the spellcaster, the guardian casts the stored spell with any parameters set by the original caster, requiring no components. When the spell is cast or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost.²

çSkeleton2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218:GenericBÜSReletons arise when animated by dark magic. They heed the summons of spellcasters who call them from their stony tombs and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of nycromantic energy or the presence of corrupting evil.

\bold{\em{Animated Dead.}} Whatever sinister force awakens a skeleton infuses its bones with a dark vitality, adhering joint to joint and reassembling dismantled limbs. This energy motivates a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. An animated skeleton retains no connection to its past, although resurrecting a skeleton restores it body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it.

While most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of other creatures besides humanoids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.

\bold{\em{Obedient Servants.}} Skeletons raised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the tasks their masters give them, regardless of the consequences. Because of their literal interpretation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. They can't read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake their heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks. A skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished. Although they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren't mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that doesn't work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.

\bold{\em{Habitual Behaviors.}} Independent skeletons temporarily or permanently free of a master's control sometimes pantomime actions from their past lives, their bones echoing the rote behaviors of their former living selves. The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can't eat. Left alone in a ballroom, the skeletons of nobles might continue an eternally unfinished dance.

When skeletons encounter living creatures, the necromantic energy that drives them compels them to kill unless they are commanded by their masters to refrain from doing so. They attack without mercy and fight until destroyed, for skeletons possess little sense of self and even less sense of self-preservation.

Skullport - Shadow of Waterdeep
DMG 308753:GenericBÔ&Prior to the inexplicable change in behaviour that came with the \Group{Xanathars} seizing power, the \Group{Skulls of Skullport} were seen as the first and final word on law and order. \Group{Skulkers} did everything in their power to not incur their wrath, or create a Disturbance. Disturbances were any behaviours that interfered with the status quo of \Place{Skullport}, as defined by the unknowable whims of the Skulls. Only one hard and fast law is known, and it is the Monolithic Decree, named for the monolith in \Place{Shadow Pass}, where it is most often heard.

\em{This be safe haven to all traders and customers. Keep your weapons and your uncivil tongue sheathed lest you find the grinning skull of Death smiling in your face.}

Disturbances that have drawn the Skullsâ€™ ire in the past include:\list{Disrupting or suppressing trade of any goods, including slaves.}{Large-scale conflict between one or more families, factions, or gangs of Skullport.}{Outward religious proselytizing or evangelizing (Though they take no offence to religious symbolism being worn or discussed).}{Use of unstable magic.}{Large-scale vandalism (though what constitutes â€˜vandalismâ€™ is often inconsistent).}{Reneging on major trade agreements.}{Trying to damage the monolith in Shadow Pass.}

However, these can hardly be taken as guidelines, as the Skulls are inscrutable, and what is considered a Disturbance varied wildly, as well as the typical response. The most extreme reaction was to disintegrate the problem person on the spot, or summon \Monster{wizshades} to slay them. However, more often, the Skulls would make some absurd demand of the offending party. Failure to abide by these demands would lead to one of the former, more deadly results. Past demands include:\list{Offer to empty the chamberpots of every single person in the Lower Heart. If they refuse, insist twice more before accepting no for an answer.}{Spend the coming week at one of the local inns. Every time a Calishite enters the inn, you must buy every person in the dining room a pint of \Item{Wyrmwizz}.}{Stand on the Murkspan bridge for 72 hours straight, and only consume what is freely given to you without your asking.}{Ask \NPC{Morganis Andropoea} how her husband is doing (See UH2).}{Treat the first goblin you see as your honoured house guest for the next monthâ€”tend to their every need and request.}

Presently, their behaviour is more in line with a cabal of senile elders. Some of the recent, strange behaviour of the Skulls includes:\list{Floating into a building, telekinetically pulling up a chair in front of a table, and floating above that chair as if it were the head of a body sitting in it. It will not leave until food is placed in front of it, at which point it telekinetically lifts the food, puts it in its mouth, makes an exaggerated chewing motion, and then floats away. The food drops onto the chair, mostly unaffected save for being bitten.}{Humming, whistling, and singing songs in an ancient, forgotten language. One who uses magic to understand the language finds that the song is macabre nonsense related to dismemberment. Sometimes several of them will join together in an accompaniment of whistling, humming, and singing.}{Hovering over \Group{Skulkers} while they sleep. Skulkers who wake are understandably startled, but if they make any sudden noises, it makes a clacking motion with its jaw as if laughing before floating away.}{Picking people up telekinetically, dangling them over the pit to the Dungeons, and then calmly putting them back down next to it.}{Floating at eye-level with travellers, bumping into them, and then constantly moving left and right to prevent them from getting by, all the while repeating 'Sorry' in different languages.}{Skulkers will occasionally get a drink spilled on their head by a Skull high above that has stolen a cup and is trying to drink.}

No one is entirely certain why this is, but theories range from 'Halasterâ€™s doing' to 'the wild magic of \Place{Undermountain} has finally broken them' to 'the \NPC{Xanathar} has a machine that makes them stupid'. Nonetheless, the Skulls of Skullport, as far as anyone can tell, cannot die. So long as \Place{Skullport} remains, the Skulls, too, remain. If one of the Skulls is somehow destroyed, a random humanoid is chosen from the resident population. The replacement Skull emerges, 24 hours later, from the head of the unlucky victim, in a spectacularly gory manner. For this and many other reasons, newcomers are harshly warned against attempting to harm the Skulls.

When possible, the Skulls prefer not to fight directly, and rely on \Monster{wizshades} to enforce their will. When they do fight, they tend to use nonlethal ethods, such as \Spell{forcecage}, \Spell{maze}, \Spell{imprisonment}, \Spell{true polymorph}, and \Spell{feeblemind} to put down Disturbances, but if necessary, they will \Spell{disintegrate} those who cause trouble.JƒThe Skulls of Skullport were the first and final word on law and order, and their behavior could be unpredictable and often absurd.r

The foremost inhabitants of this inhospitable plane are the toad-like slaadi. Slaadi are undisciplined and have no formal hierarchy, although weaker slaadi obey stronger ones under threat of annihilation.

\sub{The Spawning Stone.} Long ago, \God{Primus}, overlord of the \Monster[modron]{modrons}, created a gigantic, geometrically complex stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast it adrift in \Place{Limbo}, believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone's power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as \Monster[modron]{modrons} and \Monster{githzerai}, to create enclaves in \Place{Limbo}. However, \God{Primus}'s creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to \God{Primus}'s massive creation as the \Item{Spawning Stone} for this reason.

The slaadi wiped out every last \Monster{modron} enclave in \Place{Limbo}. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe \Monster[modron]{modrons} and attack them on sight. Nonetheless, \God{Primus} stands by his creation and either doesn't perceive the slaadi as threats or chooses to ignore them.

\sub{Birth and Transformation.} Slaadi have horrific cycles of reproduction. Slaadi reproduce either by implanting humanoid hosts with eggs or by infecting them with a transformative disease called chaos phage. Each color of slaad reproduces or transforms in a different way, with \Monster[red slaad]{red slaadi} spawning \Monster[blue slaad]{blue} and \Monster[green slaad]{green} slaadi, and \Monster[blue slaad]{blue slaadi} spawning \Monster[red slaad]{red} and \Monster[green slaad]{green}. Each \Monster{green slaad} undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more powerful \Monster[gray slaad]{gray} and \Monster[death slaad]{death slaadi}. With each transformation, the slaad retains its memories.

\sub{Shapechangers.} Some slaadi can transform into the humanoid creatures from which they were originally spawned. These slaadi return to the \Place{Material Plane} to sow discord in the guise of their former selves.J~Slaadi are undisciplined and have no formal hierarchy, although weaker slaadi obey stronger ones under threat of annihilation.zSlaadi

È	Spectator2!
Monster Manual	WTC A9218:GenericBA spectator is a lesser \Monster{beholder} that is summoned from another plane of existence by a magical ritual, the components of which include four \Monster{beholder} eyestalks that are consumed by the ritual's magic. Appropriately, a spectator has four eyes talks, two on each side of the wide eye at the center of its four-foot diameter body.

\sub{Magical Guardians.} A summoned spectator guards a location or a treasure of its summoner's choice for 101 years, allowing no creature but its summoner to enter the area or access the item, unless the summoner instructed otherwise. If the item is stolen or destroyed before the years have all passed, a summoned spectator vanishes. It otherwise never abandons its post.

\sub{Glimmers of Madness.} Though it can speak, a spectator communicates primarily by way of telepathy. It is civil while on guard, openly discussing its orders and its summoner. However, even a brief conversation with a spectator is enough to reveal quirks in its personality brought on by its years of isolation. It might invent imaginary enemies, refer to itself in the third person, or try to adopt the voice of its summoner.

Like any \Monster{beholder}, a spectator views itself as the epitome of its kind, and it has an intense hatred of other spectators. If two spectators encounter one another, they almost always fight to the death.

\sub{Freed from Service.} When a spectator has fulfilled its service, it is free to do as it pleases. Many take up residence in the places they previously guarded, especially if their summoners have died. With the spectator's loss of purpose, the flickers of madness it displayed during its servitude flourish.JpA spectator is a lesser \Monster{beholder} that is summoned from another plane of existence by a magical ritual.rspectator.png(08BBJ (0bŠ’<š

\em{2. Paralyzing Ray.} The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

\em{3. Fear Ray.} The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the target, ending the effect on itself on a success.

äSpecter2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218——:GenericBÂA specter is the angry, unfettered spirit of a humanoid that has been prevented from passing to the afterlife. Specters no longer possess connections to who or what they were, yet are condemned to walk the world forever. Some a re spawned when dark magic or the touch of a wraith rips a soul from a living body.

\em{\bold{Beyond Redemption.}} When a \Monster{ghost}'s unfinished business is completed, it can rest at last. No such rest or redemption awaits a specter. It is doomed to the \Place{Material Plane}, its only end the oblivion that comes with the destruction of its soul. Until then, it bears out its lonely life in forlorn places, carrying on forgotten through the ages of the world.

\em{\bold{Undying Hatred.}} Living creatures remind the specter that life is beyond its grasp. The mere sight of the living overwhelms a specter with sorrow and wrath, which can be abated only by destroying said life. A specter kills quickly and mercilessly, for only by depriving others of life can it gain the slightest satisfaction. However, no matter how many lives it extinguishes, a specter always succumbs to its hatred and sorrow.

\em{\bold{Dwellers in Darkness.}} Sunlight represents a source of life that no specter can ever hope to douse, and it pains them. When night falls, they leave their final resting places in search of living creatures to slay, knowing that few weapons can harm them in return. At the first light of dawn, they retreat back into the darkness, where they remain until night falls again.

ÇSuccubus*Incubus2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218œœ:GenericB¸Succubi and incubi inhabit all of the \Place{Lower Planes}, and the lascivious dark-winged \Monster{fiends} can be found in service to \Monster{devils}, \Monster{demons}, \Monster{night hags}, \Monster{rakshasas}, and \Monster{yugoloths}. \God{Asmodeus}, ruler of the Nine Hells, uses these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The demon lord \NPC{Graz'zt} keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts.

Though legend speaks of them separately, any succubus can become an incubus, and vice versa. Most of these fiends do have a preference for one form or the other. Mortals only rarely see a succubus or incubus in its true form, however, for the fiend typically begins its corruption in veiled, insidious ways.\subtitle{Beautiful Corrupters.} A succubus or incubus first appears in ethereal form, passing through walls like a ghost to lurk next to a mortal's bedside and whisper forbidden pleasures. Sleeping victims are tempted to give in to their darkest desires, indulge in taboos, and feed forbidden appetites. As the fiend fills the victim's dreams with debauched images, the victim becomes more susceptible to temptation in everyday life.

Inevitably, the fiend enters the mortal realm in tempting form to directly influence a creature's actions. Appearing in the guise of a humanoid who has previously appeared only in the victim's dreams, the succubus or incubus seduces or befriends its victim, indulging all its desires so that it performs evil acts of its own free will.

A mortal bequeaths its soul to the fiend not by formal pledge or contract. Instead, when a succubus or incubus has corrupted a creature completely - some say by causing the victim to commit the three betrayals of thought, word, and deed - the victim's soul belongs to the fiend. The more virtuous the fiend's prey, the longer the corruption takes, but the more rewarding the downfall. After successfully corrupting a victim, the succubus or incubus kills it, and the tainted soul descends into the \Place{Lower Planes}.

The succubus or incubus resorts to charming a victim magically only when necessary, usually as a form of self-defense. A charmed creature isn't responsible for its actions, so forcing it to behave against its will won't bring the fiend closer to the ultimate prize: the victim's soul.\subtitle{Deadly Kiss.} The kiss of a succubus or incubus is an echo of the emptiness that is the fiend's longing for a corrupted soul. Likewise, the recipient of the fiend's kiss gains no satisfaction from it, experiencing only pain and the profound emptiness that the fiend imparts. The kiss is nothing short of an attack, usually delivered as a final farewell before the fiend escapes.\subtitle{Fiendish Ofspring.} Succubi and incubi can reproduce with one another to spawn more of their kind. Less commonly, a succubus or incubus reproduces with a humanoid. From this unholy union, a \Monster{cambion} child is conceived. Invariably, the fiendish offspring is as wicked as its fiendish parent.J­Succubi and incubi are seductive demons that prey on the dreams and desires of mortals, leading them to commit evil acts and ensuring their souls end up in the Lower Planes.rsuccubus.pngrincubus.png"(08BB<J (0j‚	’<š

Monster Manual	WTC A9218¡¡:GenericBµTreants are awakened trees that dwell in ancient forests. Although treants prefer to while away the days, months, and years in quiet contemplation, they fiercely protect their woodland demesnes from outside threats.

\subtitle{The Sleeping Tree Awakens.} A tree destined to become a treant meditates through a long cycle of seasons, living normally for decades or centuries before realizing its potential. Trees that awaken do so only under special circumstances and in places steeped with nature's magic. Treants and powerful druids can sense when a tree has the spark of potential, and they protect such trees in secret groves as they draw near the moment of their awakening. During the long process of awakening, a tree acquires face-like features in its bark, a division of the lower trunk into legs, and long branches bending downward to serve as its arms. When it is ready, the tree pulls its legs free from the clutching earth and joins its fellows in protecting its woodland home.

\subtitle{Legendary Guardians.} After a treant awakens, it continues to grow exactly as it did when it was a tree. Treants created from the mightiest trees can reach great sizes while developing an innate magical power over plants and animals. Such treants can animate plants, using.them to ensnare and trap intruders. They can call wild creatures to aid them or carry messages across great distances.

\subtitle{Protectors of the Wild.} Even after awakening, a treant spends much of its time living as a tree. While rooted in place, a treant remains aware of its surroundings, and can perceive the effects of events taking place miles away based on subtle changes nearby. Woodcutters who avoid culling healthy living trees and hunters who take only what they need of the forest's bounty are unlikely to arouse a treant's ire. Creatures careless with fire, those who poison the forest, and those who destroy great trees, especially a tree close to awakening, face the treant's wrath.J9Treants are awakened trees that dwell in ancient forests.r

An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.

Monster Manual	WTC A9218¢¢:GenericB¨The savage, degenerate troglodytes squat in the shallow depths of the \Pace{Underdark} in a constant state of war against their neighbors and one another. They mark the borders of their territories with cracked bones and skulls, or with pictographs painted in blood or dung.

Perhaps the most loathsome of all humanoids, troglodytes eat anything they can stomach. They dwell in filth. The walls of their cavern homes are smeared with grime, oily secretions, and the debris of their foul feasting.

\em{\bold{Simpleminded Brutes.} Troglodytes have a simple, communal culture devoted almost entirely to procuring food. Too simple to plan more than a few days into the future, troglodytes rely on constant raids and hunting to survive. They take sadistic pleasure in hunting intelligent creatures weaker than themselves and show no mercy toward those they capture and drag back to their lairs to be devoured. The largest and toughest troglodytes lead the hunt and become the leaders of their tribes. However, if a leader shows any weakness or hesitation, other troglodytes attack and eat it in a frenzy.

Troglodytes make little and build less, scavenging their possessions from their prey. They understand the value of metal weapons and armor, and fight among one another for the right to have such items. A troglodyte tribe might be torn apart by battles over a single longsword.

\em{\bold{Devotees of Laogzed.}} Some troglodytes venerate \God{Laogzed}, a demonic, monstrously fat toad-lizard that slumbers in the Abyss. Laogzed offers the troglodytes nothing in return except aspiration, for it is the dream of his troglodyte worshipers to become as fat, well-fed, and wearily content as he seems to be.J”The savage, degenerate troglodytes squat in the shallow depths of the Underdark in a constant state of war against their neighbors and one another. rtroglodyte.webp

Monster Manual	WTC A9218§¨:GenericB´Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.\subtitle{Dark Desires.} Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.\subtitle{Born from Death.} Most of a vampire's victims become \Monster{vampire spawn} - ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a \Monster{spawn} to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master's control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.\subtitle{Chained to the Grave.} Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.\subtitle{Undead Nature.} Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air.\title{A Vampire's Lair} A vampire chooses a grand yet defensible location for its lair, such as a castle, fortified manor, or walled abbey. It hides its coffin in an underground crypt or vault guarded by vampire spawn or other loyal creatures of the night.\subtitle{Regional Effects} The region surrounding a vampire's lair is warped by the creature's unnatural presence, creating any of the following effects:\list{There's a noticeable increase in the populations of bats, rats, and wolves in the region.}{Plants within 500 feet of the lair wither, and their stems and branches become twisted and thorny.}{Shadows cast within 500 feet of the lair seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive.}{A creeping fog clings to the ground within 500 feet of the vampire's lair. The fog occasionally takes eerie forms, such as grasping claws and writhing serpents.}

If the vampire is destroyed, these effects end after 2d6 days.JÌVampires are undead creatures that hunger for blood and are bound to darkness, unable to cast shadows or reflections. They are also vulnerable to sunlight and require burial places to rest during the day.rvampire.png"(08BJ (0Zb‚’xš

Shapechanger¨If the vampire isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph in to a Tiny \Monster{bat} or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.

While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.ªg
Legendary Restistance (3/Day)FIf the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.ªñ
Misty EscapeàWhen it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.

While it has 0 hit points in mist form , it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.ª–
Regeneration…The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.ª†
Spider ClimbvThe vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.ª‰
Vampire WeaknessôThe vampire has the following flaws:

\em{Forbiddance.} The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants,

\em{Harmed by Running Water}. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.

\em{Stake to the Heart.} If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

\em{Sunlight Hypersensitivity.} The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.²8

The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a \Monster{vampire spawn} under the vampire's control. The target must be willing, \Condition{grappled} by the vampire, \Condition{incapacitated}, or \Condition{restrained}.Â´
CharmªThe vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack.

Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.ÂÇ
Children of the Night (1/Day)¥The vampire magically calls 2d4 \Monster[swarm of bats]{swarms of bats} or \Monster[swarm of rats]{rats}, provided that the sun isn't up.

Waterdeep - Dragon Heist	WTC C4658ÚÚ:GenericBõ
The lord of House Cassalanter is a devilishly handsome half-elf who likes coin and power. He and his wife gained both by cutting a deal with Asmodeus - which involved trading away the souls of their three children.

Victoro is a priest of \God{Asmodeus}, though his devotion to the Lord of the Nine Hells is a secret known only to his wife and his closest friends. Most Waterdavians know him as a successful banker, philanthropist, and worshiper of \God{Lathander}. Some of his business profits go toward feeding and sheltering the poor. But behind this veneer of generosity, Victoro is a self-serving beast.

The soul of Victoro's eldest son, \NCP{Osvaldo}, is forever lost and can't be saved. To allay his guilt. Victoro has forged a plan to win back the souls of his young twins, \NPC{Terenzio} and \NPC{Elzerina}. Under the terms of the contract, their souls will be forfeit on their ninth birthdays, and that day is fast approaching. But Victoro can buy his way out of the obligation by providing, as the contract states, 'one shy of a million gold coins and the sacrifice of one shy of a hundred unfortunate souls.'

Victoro is well schooled, suave, slow to anger, and blessed with good health, long life, and immunity to disease. He dresses in the latest fashions and walks with a ruby-tipped cane, though not because he needs to. This cane has the magical properties of a rod of rulership.JThe lord of House Cassalanter.rvictoro cassalanter.png(8J (0PZb	z	Š

They are wiry and twitchy in humanoid form, with thin hair and darting eyes. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, wererats prefer light weapons and use ambush tactics rather than fighting as a pack. Although a wererat can deliver a nasty bite in its rat form, it favors that form for stealthy infiltration and escape rather than combat.

A wererat clan operates much like a thieves' guild, with wererats transmitting their curse only to creatures they want to induct into the clan. Wererats that are accidentally cursed or break loose from the clan's control are quickly hunted down and killed.

Wererat clans are found throughout urban civilization, often dwelling in cellars and catacombs. These creatures are common in the sewers beneath major cities, viewing those subterranean areas as their hunting grounds.

\bold{\em{Hope and Doom.}} Will-o'-wisps look like bobbing lantern lights in the distance, although they can choose to alter their colors, or wink out completely. When they activate their lights, will-o'-wisps offer hope, hinting of safety to creatures that follow them.

Will-o'-wisps lure unwary creatures into quicksand pits, monster lairs, and other dangerous places so that they can feed on the suffering of their prey and revel in their death screams. An evil being that falls prey to a will-o'-wisp might become a wisp itself, its woeful spirit coalescing above its lifeless corpse like a flickering flame.

\bold{\em{Consumed by Despair.}} Will-o'-wisps are the souls of evil beings that perished in anguish or misery as they wandered forsaken lands permeated with powerful magic. They thrive in swampy bogs and bone-strewn battlefields where the oppressive weight of sorrow stoops even heavier than the low-hanging mist and fog. Trapped in these desolate places of lost hope and memory, will-o'-wisps lure other creatures toward dismal fates and feed on their misery.

\bold{\em{Agents of Evil.}} Will-o'-wisps rarely speak, but when they do, their voices sound like faint or distant whispers. In the miserable domains they haunt, will-o'-wisps sometimes form symbiotic relationships with their wicked neighbors. \Monster[hag]{Hags}, \Monster{oni}, \Monster[black dragon]{black dragons}, and evil cultists work with will-o'-wisps to draw creatures into ambush. As their evil allies surround and slaughter creatures, the wisps hover above them, drinking the agony of a last breath and savoring the sensation as the light of life goes out in a creature's eyes.

¹Wraith2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218®®:GenericBýA wraith is malice incarnate, concentrated into an incorporeal form that seeks to quench all life. The creature is suffused with negative energy, and its mere passage through the world leaves nearby plants blackened and withered. Animals flee from its presence. Even small fires can be extinguished by the sucking oblivion of the wraith's horrifying existence.\subtitle{Vile Oblivion.} When a mortal humanoid lives a debased life or enters into a fiendish pact, it consigns its soul to eternal damnation in the \Place{Lower Planes}. However, sometimes the soul becomes so suffused with negative energy that it collapses in on itself and ceases to exist the instant before it can shuffle off to some horrible afterlife. When this occurs, the spirit becomes a soulless wraith - a malevolent void trapped on the plane where it died. Almost nothing of the wraith's former existence is preserved; in this new form, it exists only to annihilate other life.\subtitle{Bereft of Body.} A wraith can move through solid creatures and objects as easily as a mortal creature moves through fog.

A wraith might retain a few memories of its mortal life as shadowy echoes. However, even the strongest events and emotions become little more than faint impressions, fleeting as half-remembered dreams. A wraith might pause to stare at something that fascinated it in life, or it might curb its wrath in acknowledgment of a past friendship. Such moments come rarely, however, because most wraiths despise what they were as a reminder of what they have become.\subtitle{Undead Commanders.} A wraith can make an undead servant from the spirit of a humanoid creature that has recently suffered a violent death. Such a fragment of woe becomes a \Monster{specter}, spiteful of all that lives.

 Wraiths sometimes rule the legions of the dead, plotting the doom of living creatures. When they emerge from their tombs to do battle, life and hope shrivel before them. Even if a wraith's armies are forced to retreat, the lands its forces occupied are so blasted and withered that those who live there often starve and die.\subtitle{Undead Nature.} A wraith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.JtWraiths are soul-devouring undead creatures that can move through solid objects, wither plants and extinguish fires.rwraith.webp(8	BB<J (0z	‚Š

Dungeon of the Mad Mage	WTC C4639EF:GenericBáWyllow is a \Monster{moon elf} druid with eyes as green as emeralds. Butterflies nest in her tangled black hair, and small critters gather around her feet.

Over two hundred years ago, Wyllow fell in love with \NPC{Yinark}, a wizard in league with Halaster, and returned with him to \Place{Undermountain}. Her happiness faded quickly when the dungeon proved to be a far cry from the woods she called home. Determined to keep Wyllow in \Place{Undermountain}, \NPC{Halaster} used several wish spells to create a magical forest for her, but even this gift wasn't enough to offset the druid's languor. When \NPC{Yinark} forbade her from ever returning to the surface, Wyllow grew positively despondent. The relationship soured and turned violent. A volley of spells on both sides resulted in \NPC{Yinark}'s death. After Wyllow's fury abated, all that remained was undying grief and encroaching madness. She remains in \Place{Undermountain} in accordance with \NPC{Yinark}'s wishes, a prisoner of her own guilt.

\Place{Undermountain} is Wyllow's home now, and all memory of the surface world has faded from her mind. She is distant but kind toward those who pass harmlessly through her domain, but turns violent whenever her forest or its peaceful denizens are threatened. Before setting out to destroy interlopers, she rallies the \Monster{green dragon} and the \Monster{werebats}, using them to soften up her adversaries. She can also summon six \Monster{awakened trees} from the forest with a whistle.

Wyllow's \Monster{displacer beast} companion, Crissann, is named after a \Monster{human} mercenary whom the \Monster{elf} befriended many years ago. Before this friendship could blossom into a romance, \NPC{Halaster} intervened and used his magic to turn Wyllow's new friend against her. The heartbroken druid slew \NPC{Crissann} in the woods with the help of several forest creatures and vowed never to let another mortal touch her heart so deeply.

Wyllow has conflicted feelings about \NPC{Halaster}. She is grateful to him for providing her a home and keeping \Place{Wyllowwood} alive with his magic, but she blames him for \NPC{Yinark}'s death. She also pities him, for the \NPC{Mad Mage} too appears to be trapped in a prison of his own making. Wyllow believes he is no longer \Monster{human}, but an immortal entity composed of pure magic. Thus, she has given up any hope of being rid of him.J„Wyllow, a moon elf druid trapped in Undermountain by grief, protects her magical forest home with a loyal green dragon and werebats.r

äWyvern2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218¯¯:GenericBòTravelers in the wild sometimes look to the skies to see the dark-winged shape of a wyvern carrying its prey. These cousins to the great \Monster{dragons} hunt the same tangled forests and caverns as their kin. Their appearance sends ripples of alarm through the borderlands of civilization.

A wyvern has two scaly legs, leathery wings, and a sinewy tail topped with its most potent weapon: a poison stinger. The poison in a wyvern's stinger can kill a creature in seconds. Extremely potent, wyvern poison burns through its victim's bloodstream, disintegrating veins and arteries on its way to the heart. As deadly as wyverns can be, however, hunters and adventurers often track them to claim the venom, which is used in alchemical compounds and to coat weapons.\subtitle{Aerial Hunters.} A wyvern doesn't fight on the ground unless it can't reach its prey by any other means, or if it has been fooled into a position from which aerial combat isn't an option. If forced into a confrontation on the ground, a wyvern crouches low, keeping its stinger poised above its head as it hisses and growls.\subtitle{Aggressive and Reckless.} A wyvern intent on its prey backs down only if it sustains serious injury, or if its prey eludes it long enough for another easier potential meal to wander along. If it corners a fleeing creature in an enclosure too small to enter, a wyvern guards where the quarry hides, lashing with its stinger whenever opportunity allows.

Although they possess more cunning than ordinary beasts, wyverns lack the intelligence of their draconic cousins. As such, creatures that maintain their composure as a wyvern hunts them from the air can often elude or trick it. Wyverns follow a direct path to their prey, with no thought given to possible ambushes.\subtitle{Tamed Wyverns.} A wyvern can be tamed for use as a mount, but doing so presents a difficult and deadly challenge. Raising one as a hatchling offers the best results. However, a wyvern's violent temperament has cost the life of many a would-be master.JªWyverns are dangerous predatory creatures that can be deadly if cornered or provoked. They are sometimes used as mounts, but taming one is a difficult and dangerous task.r

Waterdeep - Dragon Heist	WTC C4658ÜÜ:GenericB·Xanathar is the name given to the beholder crime lord that lives in the dungeons under \Place{Waterdeep}. It isn't the first \Monster{beholder} to claim this mantle, nor will it be the last.

Like all beholders, Xanathar is a paranoid tyrant that charms and bullies its minions into servitude. The \Group{Xanathar Guild} is made up of some of Waterdeep's most disreputable folk, as well as monsters forced into subservience or drawn to the beholder by the promise of treasure, food, or power. Treachery within the ranks of the guild is common as servants vie for the beholder's favor and affection. Such boons are fleeting, though, as the beholder is quick to distrust those who finagle their way into its good graces.

Xanathar lives in a dungeon under \Place{Skullport}, a subterranean settlement connected to \Place{Undermountain}'s third level. The place resembles a ramshackle town, built inside a giant cavern connected to an underground river. Members of the Xanathar Guild haunt Skullport's dilapidated buildings, and \Monster[flameskull]{flameskulls} patrol its streets.

The only creature Xanathar truly cares about aside from itself is a fish, named \NPC{Sylgar}, that it keeps in a large glass tank. Xanathar has minions that look after the fish constantly, but even their ministracions can't keep such a creature alive forever. Whenever the fish dies, panic spreads through the occupants of the lair as minions try to replace the fish before Xanathar realizes what has happened. Luckily for them, the beholder can't tell one fish from another.

Xanathar is extremely fond of gold. A few years ago, its spies stole the \Item{Stone of Golorr}, which contained information that led to the discovery of a dwarven vault under \Place{Waterdeep}. Xanathar was able to open the vault, but was forced out by the dragon inside the place. Recently. someone stole the \Item{Stone of Golorr} from where it was hidden inside its lair, and the beholder is convinced that the \Group{Black Network} is behind the theft.

The beholder is caught up in the unbreakable grip of its own paranoia. It sees enemies everywhere. and lashes out at anyone it suspects of being a \Group{Zhentarim} spy or assassin. Adventurers who attract its attention by dealing with known or suspected \Group{Black Network} operatives are quickly branded as enemies that must be destroyed.J7The \Monster{beholder} crime lord of \Place{Waterdeep}.rxanathar.webpâRing of invisibilityâRing of mind shieldingâRing of force resistance

On the \Place{Material Plane}, xorn must range far and wide through the \Place{Underdark} to sustain themselves, becoming aggressive toward miners and treasure hunters when the valuable minerals of their diet are scarce.

A xorn's unnatural origins are suggested by its unusually heavy body and the large, powerful mouth sitting atop its head. Its three long arms are each tipped with sharp talons, and its three large, stone-lidded eyes see in all directions.\subtitle{Elemental Travelers.} Possessed of the power of elemental earth, a xorn glides through stone and dirt as easily as a fish swims through water. It doesn't displace earth or stone when it moves, but merges with and flows through it, leaving no tunnel, hole, or hint of its passage.

Xorn prefer not to leave their home plane, where they easily eat their fill of gemstones and precious metals. When a xorn winds up on the \Place{Material Plane}, whether by accident or from curiosity, it seeks sustenance and a way home.\subtitle{Beggars and Thieves.} Xorn scour the depths of the earth for precious metal and stones. Because they are unable to consume organic material, they ignore most other creatures. However, a xorn's ability to sniff out metals and stones often draws its attention to adventurers carrying coins and gems. Because a xorn isn't evil, it pleads or bargains in the hope of convincing owners to give up their treasure, offering up information it has learned from its travels in exchange. A xorn whose requests are ignored might resort to threats and bullying.

The lady of House Gralhund is no fool. She has a keen mind and the wisdom to discern friend from foe. She also has a husband who worships her (see \NPC{Orond Gralhund} page 213) and a house that has the resources of the Black Network at its disposal.

Yalah stays abreast of events in the city, keeps a tight rein on her children, and uses her station and her family's wealth to pry secrets from the lips of nobles, guildmasters, and commoners alike. Though her previous attempts to become a Masked Lord have been thwarted, she believes it's only a matter of time until that honor is bestowed on her. Once she knows the identities and secrets of enough Masked Lords, Yalah is confident that she can bribe, blackmail, or extort her way into their ranks. From there, she plans to effect changes in the government that will ensure House Gralhund's prosperity for generations to come.

Yalah shares the services of a half-ore bodyguard with her husband, although \NPC{Hrabbaz} (see page 205) is more loyal to her than to him. She also uses the Zhentarim who are based in House Gralhund as her personal spy network, not realizing that the Zhents' true master is Manshoon.

Monster Manual	WTC A9218³³:GenericBðYuan-ti are devious serpent folk devoid of compassion. From remote temples in jungles, swamps, and deserts, the yuan-ti plot to supplant and dominate all other races and to make themselves gods.\subtitle{Forsaken Humanity.} The yuan-ti were once humans who thrived in the earliest days of civilization and worshiped serpents as totem animals. They lauded the serpent's sinuous flexibility, its calculated poise, and its deadly strike. Their advanced philosophy taught the virtue of detachment from emotion and of clear, focused thought.

Yuan-ti culture was among the richest in the mortal world. Their warriors were legendary, their empires always expanding. Yuan-ti temples stood at the centers of ancient metropolises, reaching ever higher in prayer to the gods they longed to emulate. In time, the serpent gods heard those prayers, their sibilant voices responding from the darkness as they told the yuan-ti what they must do. The yuan-ti religion grew more fanatical in its devotion. Cults bound themselves to the worship of the serpent gods and imitated their ways, indulging in cannibalism and humanoid sacrifice. Through foul sorcery, the yuan-ti bred with snakes, utterly sacrificing their humanity to become like the serpent gods in form, as well as in thought and emotion.\subtitle{Serpent Kings of Fallen Empires.}  The yuan-ti view their physical transformation as a transcendent moment for their race, allowing them to shed their frail humanity like dead skin. Those that did not transform eventually became slaves or food for the blessed of the serpent gods. The yuan-ti empires withered or were defeated by those who fought against their cannibalism and slavery, and the serpent folk were left in the ruins of their great capitals, far removed from other races.\subtitle{Cold of Heart.} Humanoid emotions are foreign to most yuan-ti, which understand sentiment only as an exploitable weakness. A yuan-ti views the world and the events of its own life with such extreme pragmatism that it is nearly impossible to manipulate, influence, or control by nonmagical means, even as it seeks to control other creatures through terror, pleasure, and awe.

Yuan-ti know that the world they hope to rule can't be bound for long by brute force, and that many creatures will refuse to serve. As a result, yuan-ti first influence other creatures with the promise of wealth and power. Time and again, humanoid cultures make the fatal mistake of trusting the yuan-ti. They forget that a yuan-ti that acts honorably or lends aid in a time of trouble does so only as part of a grander design.

Yuan-ti leaders are cunning and ruthless tacticians who readily sacrifice lesser yuan-ti if potential victory justifies such losses. They have no sense of honorable combat and strike first in decisive ambush if they can.\subtitle{False Worship.} Yuan-ti life revolves around their temples, yet yuan-ti don't love the gods they worship. Instead, they see worship as a means to attain power. A yuan-ti believes an individual who attains enough power can devour and replace one of the yuan-ti gods. The yuan-ti strive for ascension and are willing to commit the darkest atrocities to achieve it.J®uan-ti are a race of serpent-like humanoids who are cold, calculating, and ruthless.

±#Yugoloth2#
Monster Manual	WTC A9218··:GenericBø!Yugoloths are fickle fiends that inhabit the planes of \Place{Acheron}, \Place{Gehenna}, \Place{Hades}, and \Place{Carceri}. They act as mercenaries and are notorious for their shifting loyalties. They are the embodiments of avarice. Before serving under anyone's banner, a yugoloth asks the only question on its mind: What's in it for me?\subtitle{Spawn ofGehenna.} The first yugoloths were created by a sisterhood of \Monster[night hag]{night hags} on \Place{Gehenna}. It is widely believed that \God{Asmodeus}, Lord of the \Place{Nine Hells}, commissioned the work, in the hope of creating an army of \Monster{fiends} that were not bound to the \Place{Nine Hells}. In the course of making this new army, the \Monster{hags} crafted four magic tomes and recorded the true names of every yugoloth they created, save one, the \NPC{General of Gehenna}. These tomes were called the \Item{Books of Keeping}. Since knowing a fiend's true name grants power over it, the \Monster{hags} used the books to ensure the yugoloths' loyalty. They also used the books to capture the true names of other fiends that crossed them. It is rumored that the \Item{Books of Keeping} contain the true names of a few \Monster{demon lords} and \Monster{arch devils} as well.

Petty jealousies and endless bickering caused the sisterhood to dissolve, and in the ensuing power grab, the \Item{Books of Keeping} were lost or stolen. No longer indentured to anyone, the yugoloths gained independence, and they now offer their services to the highest bidder.\subtitle{Fiendish Mercenaries.} Summoned yugoloths demand much for their time and loyalty. Whatever promises a yugoloth makes are quickly broken when a better opportunity presents itself. Unlike \Monster{demons}, yugoloths can be reasoned with, but unlike \Monster{devils}, they are rarely true to their word.

Yugoloths can be found anywhere, but the high cost of maintaining a yugoloth army's loyalty typically exceeds what any warlord on the \Place{Material Plane} can pay.

Being self-serving creatures, yugoloths quarrel among themselves constantly. A yugoloth army is more organized than a ravening horde of \Monster{demons}, but far less orderly and regimented than a legion of \Monster{devils}. Without a powerful leader to keep them in line, yugoloths fight simply to indulge their violent predilections, and only as long as it benefits them to do so.\subtitle{Back to Gehenna.} When a yugoloth dies, it dissolves into a pool of ichor and reforms at full strength on the \Place{Bleak Eternity of Gehenna}. Only on its native plane can a yugoloth be destroyed permanently. A yugoloth knows this and acts accordingly. When summoned to other planes, a yugoloth fights without concern for its own well-being. On \Place{Gehenna}, it is more apt to retreat or plead for mercy if its demise seems imminent.

When a yugoloth is permanently destroyed, its name vanishes from every \Item{Book of Keeping}. If a yugoloth is re-created by way of an unholy ritual requiring the expenditure of souls, its name reappears in the books.\subtitle{The Books of Keeping.} When all four copies of the \Item{Books of Keeping} disappeared, \God{Asmodeus} and the \Monster{night hags} lost control of their yugoloth creations. Each \Item{Book of Keeping} still exists, drifting from plane to plane, where the brave and the foolish occasionally stumble upon them. A yugoloth summoned using its true name, as inscribed in the \item{Books of Keeping}, is forced to serve its summoner obediently. The yugoloth hates being controlled in this manner and isn't shy about making its displeasure known. Like a petulant child, it will follow its instructions to the letter while looking for opportunities to misinterpret them.\subtitle{The General of Gehenna.} Somewhere in the brimstone wastes of \Place{Gehenna}, there roams an \Monster{ultroloth} so strong that none contests his power: the \NPC{General of Gehenna}. Many yugoloths search for this great general in the hope of serving with him. They believe that service with the \NPC{General of Gehenna} grants power and prestige among lower planar entities.

Whatever the case, no \Monster{fiend} finds the \NPC{General} unless the \NPC{General} desires it. His personal name is unknown, and even the \Item{Books of Keeping} contain no mention of this powerful, thoroughly evil entity.J|Yugoloths are fickle fiends that inhabit the planes of \Place{Acheron}, \Place{Gehenna}, \Place{Hades}, and \Place{Carceri}.(

Monster Manual	WTC A9218»¼:GenericBžFrom somewhere in the darkness, a gurgling moan is heard. A form lurches into view, dragging one foot as it raises bloated arms and broken hands. The zombie advances, driven to kill anyone too slow to escape its grasp.

\em{\bold{Dark Servants.}} Sinister necromantic magic infuses the remains of the dead, causing them to rise as zombies that do their creator's bidding without fear or hesitation. They move with a jerky, uneven gait, clad in the moldering apparel they wore when put to rest, and carrying the stench of decay.

Most zombies are made from humanoid remains, though the flesh and bones of any formerly living creature can be imbued with a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, usually from spells, animates a zombie. Some zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, a creature can't be restored to life except by powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell.

A zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A zombie left without orders simply stands in place and rots unless something comes along that it can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.

\em{\bold{Hideous Forms.}} Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.

\em{\bold{Mindless Soldiers.}} Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields littered with caltrops without hesitation.

A zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited to shambling in whatever direction it is pointed, pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won't retrieve a dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so.

\em{\bold{Undead Nature.}} A zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.J+An animated corpse that attacks mindlessly.r
