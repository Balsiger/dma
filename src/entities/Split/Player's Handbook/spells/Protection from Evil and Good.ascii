  description: "Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.\n\nThe protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also canâ€™t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect."
