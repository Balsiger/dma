  description: "These curved elven greatswords have an unusual weight to them that makes them horrendously unwieldy to one who is not specially trained in their use. A creature who has not received specialized training with the courtblade suffers disadvantage to hit with the weapon. A trained wielder, however, is a truly lethal sight to behold on the battlefield, as they use the bladeâ€™s unusual weight and momentum to their advantage in a carefully-choreographed dance. Courtblades are rarely available for sale, and those claiming to sell a courtblade are often charlatans peddling fake goods. True courtblades are forged by the elves, and typically only given as gifts. A non-elf who wields a courtblade draws both respect and suspicion from elves who understand the importance of the weapon."
