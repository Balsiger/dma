This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul m im icry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a \Monster{skeleton} if you chose bones or a \Monster{zombie} if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature‚Äôs game statistics).

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you‚Äôve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends.

Player's Handbook	WTC A9217„‰:GenericBÑUntil the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\subtitle{Flood.} You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave‚Äôs path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\subtitle{Part Water.} You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell‚Äôs area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\subtitle{Redirect Flow.} You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell‚Äôs area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\subtitle{Whirlpool.} This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.

When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn‚Äôt caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.

The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.J„This spell allows you to control any freestanding water within a 100-foot cube and choose from various effects such as flooding an area, parting water to create a trench, redirecting the flow of water, or conjuring a whirlpool. *08@J$A drop of water and a pinch of dust.R0Z

If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn‚Äôt speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature ‚Äî what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature‚Äôs thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature‚Äôs mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature‚Äôs thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can‚Äôt see.

A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a \Spell{true resurrection} or a \Spell{wish} spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force.

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature‚Äôs concentration is broken.

When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

 This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.

Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell‚Äôs area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure‚Äôs edge as it opens.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.

When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can‚Äôt leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the \Place{Ethereal Plane}, blocking ethereal travel.

This spell can‚Äôt be dispelled by \Spell{dispel magic}.JúA magical cage or solid box imprisons creatures within its area, preventing them from leaving by nonmagical means, teleporting, or using interplanar travel. *08@JRuby dust worth 1'500 gp.R0Z

Player's Handbook	WTC A9217¸˝:GenericBßYou create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn‚Äôt age. Divination spells can‚Äôt locate or perceive the target.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.

\sub{Burial.} The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.

The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.

\sub{Chaining.} Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can‚Äôt move or be moved by any means until then.

The special com ponent for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.\sub{Hedged Prison.} The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.

The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.

\sub{Minimus Containment.} The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is im prisoned inside a gem stone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can‚Äôt be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.

The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.

\sub{Slumber.} The target falls asleep and can‚Äôt be awoken.

The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.

\sub{Ending the Spell.} During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature‚Äôs name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.

A \Spell{dispel magic} spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.

You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.JPYou create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. 	*08@JœA  vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target.RZ b)A creature that you can see within range.j

If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becom es charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target‚Äôs m em ories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target‚Äôs memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature‚Äôs memory isn‚Äôt altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn‚Äôt necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature‚Äôs natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream.

Player's Handbook	WTC A9217àà:GenericBùYou craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall ‚Äî it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm‚Äôs reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm‚Äôs area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking.

This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target‚Äôs (or the target‚Äôs level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target‚Äôs game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its norm al form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn‚Äôt reduce the creature‚Äôs normal form to 0 hit points, it isn‚Äôt knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can‚Äôt speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d 100 and consults the table.

'Associated object' means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard‚Äôs library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich‚Äôs secret tomb.

'Very familiar' is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. 'Seen casually' is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren‚Äôt very familiar. 'Viewed once' is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. 'Description' is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else‚Äôs description, perhaps from a map.

'False destination' is a place that doesn‚Äôt exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy‚Äôs sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\subtitle{On Target.} You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\subtitle{Off Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\subtitle{Similar Area.} You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that‚Äôs visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard‚Äôs laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\subtitle{Mishap.} The spell‚Äôs unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.

Teleportation Circle2&
Player's Handbook	WTC A9217öö:GenericB€	As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed som ewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence ‚Äî a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM.

You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation becomes permanent.

Shapechangers aren‚Äôt affected by this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn‚Äôt affected by this spell.\subtitle{Creature into Creature.} If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target‚Äôs (or its level, if the target doesn‚Äôt have a challenge rating). The target‚Äôs game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn‚Äôt reduce the creature‚Äôs normal form to 0 hit points, it isn‚Äôt knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can‚Äôt speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless its new form is capable of such actions

The target‚Äôs gear melds into the new form. The creature can‚Äôt activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\subtitle{Object into Creature.} You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature‚Äôs size is no larger than the object‚Äôs size and the creature‚Äôs challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The DM has the creature‚Äôs statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.

If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.\subtitle{Creature into Object.} If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature‚Äôs statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its norm al form.J• You transform a creature or object into a different creature, object, or vice versa.

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can‚Äôt be dispelled by \Spell{dispel magic}. A \Spell{disintegrate} spell destroys the wall instantly, however.

If the webs aren‚Äôt anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.JTYou conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range.  *08@JA bit of spiderweb.R0Z

”Glyph of Warding*Warding, Glyph of2&
Player's Handbook	WTC A9217ıˆ:GenericBÃWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place, if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.

You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.

\bold{\em{Explosive Runes:}} When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. The Sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the aura must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.

\bold{\em{Spell Glyph:}} You can store a prepared spell of 3rd Level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires Concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.J,Inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures. *08@JLIncense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumesRZ (b7Either a surface or within an object that can be closedjrñWhen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
