  worlds: "Generic"
  description: "This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\n\nThe apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the following statistics:\n\n\n\n\\bold{Armor Class:} 20\n\n\\bold{Hit Points:} 200\n\n\\bold{Speed:} 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)\n\n\\bold{Damage Immunities:} poison, psychic\n\n\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\n The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.\n\n\n\n\\table[Lever][Up][Down]{1}{Legs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim}{Legs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus's speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed}{2}{Forward window shutter opens.}{Forward window shutter closes.}{3}{Side window shutters open (two per side)}{Side window shutters close (two per side).}{4}{Two claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus.}{The claws retract.}{5}{Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hi, reach 5ft., one target.

  description: "\\subtitle{History} Created by a legendary gnome tinkerer, this tool belt is a wellcrafted and ingenious way for a master craftsman to always have his tools handy without carrying around a heavy toolbox of multiple sets of tools. Instead, this magical item contains several sets of tools.\\subtitle{Effects} This magical belt is not unlike a \\Item{Bag of Holding} in it's effect. It contains an enchantment that allows all the commonly used tool-sets by the attuned wearer, and provides those tools at no additional weight. When the wearer is attuned, the wearer is considered proficient with all tools provided by the belt. However, the belt does not provide double-proficiency if the wearer is already proficient with certain tools. The tools provided by this belt include:\\list{Alchemist's Supplies}{Brewer's Supplies}{Calligrapher's Supplies}{Carpenter's Tools}{Cartographer's Tools}{Cobbler's Tools}{Cook's Utensils}{Glassblower's Tools}{Jeweler's Tools}{Leatherworker's Tools}{Mason's Tools}{Painter's Supplies}{Potter's Tools}{Smith's Tools}{Tinker's Tools}{Weaver's Tools}{Woodcarver's Tools}{Disguise Kit}{Forgery Kit}{Herbalism Kit}{Navigator's Tools}{Poisoner's Kit}{Thieves' Tools}."

A trained wielder, however, is a truly lethal sight to behold on the battlefield, as they use the blade’s unusual weight and momentum to their advantage in a carefully-choreographed dance. Courtblades are rarely available for sale, and those claiming to sell a courtblade are often charlatans peddling fake goods. True courtblades are forged by the elves, and typically only given as gifts. A non-elf who wields a courtblade draws both respect and suspicion from elves who understand the importance of the weapon."

  description: "This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring you to use an action to speak it.\n\nOne command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.\n\nThe second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide; and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures omfortably.\n\nWhen the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.\n\nThe third command word causes the folding boat to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so."

The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty. It takes ten minutes for the fortress to grow from a one-inch cube to it's full size.\n\nWhile \\Item{Daern's Instant Fortress} is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Halaster's improvement on that infamous magical device is 100ft on a side and 60ft high. It has no arrow slits, but it does have a battlement surrounding the second floor.\n\nIts interior is divided into two floors, with a double staircase to connect them. When activated, the tower has a double door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the \\Spell{knock} spell and similar magic, such as that of a \\Item{chime of opening}. The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a \\Spell{wish} spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points."

The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.\n\nAlternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the \\Spell{grease} spell in that area for 8 hours."

The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be u ed to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.\n\nYou can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.\n\nIf the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\n\nPlacing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, Heward's handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the \\Place{Astral Plane}. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the \\Place{Astral Plane}. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened."

  description: "Centuries ago, twelve \\Monster{drow} lead by \\NPC{Qilue Veladorn} were chosen by Eilistraee for a great quest. To aid them in this quest, each was bestowed a singing sword. Each is either a \\Item{courtblade} or a \\Item{greatsword}, and was named by the first wielder. Four of these swords are carried by members of the Chosen, while the other eight have been lost to the ages in various missions.\n\nSinging swords can only be attuned by one considered worthy by \\God{Eilistraee}, a chaotic good \\Monster{drow} goddess who embodies freedom, art, love, and beauty. Characters who enslave others or engage in acts of senseless cruelty can never attune to such a weapon unless they atone and grow to be better people — such a creature who attempts to attune to the weapon takes 22 (4d10) radiant damage and drops it. \\God{Eilistraee} favours those whose actions bring beauty into the world, but does not care for rigid codes or firm rules. She has a special softspot for those of checkered pasts who sincerely seek to self-improve.\n\nA singing sword functions as a +1 weapon (either courtblade or greatsword), and its fine craftsmanship increases its damage die by one step (to a d12 for courtblades, and 2d8 for greatswords). Additionally, as a bonus action, a wielder can initiate its battle song, which lasts for 1 hour, or until the weapon is sheathed, dropped, or deactivated as a bonus action. Allies within 60 feet who can hear the song, including the wielder, cannot be charmed or frightened, and any such effect is suppressed on them so long as they are affected by the song. Additionally, affected creatures add a d4 to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws so long as they can hear the song.\n\nOnce this property is used, it cannot be use again until the next dawn. Alternatively, an attuned creature can recharge this effect by taking 10 minutes to play a song for the sword, and making a DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check. On a success, the sword instantly recharges this ability.\n\n On a failure, this cannot be attempted again until the following dawn. Each additional time this is done in a day, the DC for the check increases by 5.\n\n The twelve singing swords, and their various statuses, are as follows:\\list{\\bold{Feradas:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \\NPC{Qilue}, who dove into the \\Place{Pit of Ghaunadaur} and did battle with its monstrosities to win the \\Group{Keepers of the Song} enough time to seal it off. Her body, and the sword, were never recovered. Some believe this sword to have had unique properties, but others believe that it was just \\NPC{Qilue}’s exceptional nature.}{\\bold{Juris:} Courtblade; currently wielded by \\NPC{Iljrene.}}{\\bold{Aella:} Greatsword; currently wielded by \\NPC{Elkantar.}}{\\bold{Milthanyr:} Courtblade; currently wielded by \\NPC{Duthra}.}{\\bold{Kadas:} Courtblade; currently wielded by \\NPC{Furia}.}{\\bold{Valyorta:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \\NPC{Domna}, who was deployed on a mission to find the \\Place{Lost Level}. Never returned.}{\\bold{Nylgoth:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \\NPC{Ryzz}, who was deployed on a mission to find the \\Item{Throne of Syglaeth Audark}. Never returned.}{\\bold{Tritz:} Greatsword; previously wielded by \\NPC{Vykus}, who was deployed in an attack on a cult of \\God{Ghaunadaur on the Twisted Caverns}. The mission was a success, but at great cost — \\NPC{Vykus} was swallowed by a beast of \\God{Ghaunadaur}, and her body, as well as her sword, were never recovered.}{\\bold{Azurith:} Greatsword; previously wielded by \\NPC{Vandin}, who was caught in an ambush by drow on the \\Place{Crystal Labyrinth} while investigating signs of \\God{Juiblex}’s influence there. Only one member of the unit, \\NPC{Fimdell}, made it back, and he did so without his superior’s sword.}{\\bold{Momath:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \\NPC{Oren}, who was betrayed and pushed through a gate into the tenth floor of \\Place{Undermountain}, where the \\Monster{drow} of \\Group{House Auvryndar} made quick work of her.}{\\bold{Vitanna:} Greatsword; previously wielded by \\NPC{Trun}, who is thought to have been killed while on a scouting mission in \\Place{Waterdeep}. The sword is in the possession of a noble, but no one knows which.}{\\bold{Sornafein:} Courtblade; previously wielded by \\NPC{Selddar}, who tried to establish a secondary base of operations in \\Place{Slitherswamp}. The base was partially-built when, all of a sudden, messages from it stopped. No one is certain what become of Sornafein or its wielder.}"

On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2 charges.\n\n\\sub{Power Strike.} When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.\n\n\\sub{Spells.} While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: \\Spell{cone of cold} (5 charges), \\Spell{fireball} (5th-level version, 5 charges), \\Spell{globe of invulnerability} (6 charges), \\Spell{hold monster} (5 charges), \\Spell{levitate} (2 charges), \\Spell{lightning bolt} (5th-level version, 5 charges), \\Spell{magic missile} (1 charge), \\Spell{ray of enfeeblement} (1 charge), or \\Spell{wall of force} (5 charges).\n\n\\sub{Retributive Strike.} You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.\n\nYou have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 x the number of charges in the taff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a uccessful save, a creature takes half as much damage.\n\n\\table[Distance from Origin][Damage]{10 ft. away or closer}{8 x the number of charges in the staff}{11 to 20 ft. away}{6 x the number of charges in the staff}{21 to 30 ft. away}{4 x the number of charges in the staff}"

  description: "The Stone of Golorr is a glossy, greenish-gray stone that fits in the palm of your hand. The stone is actually an \\Monster{aboleth} named \\NPC{Golorr}, transformed by magic into an object.\n\n\\em{\\bold{Legend Lore.}} The Stone of Golorr has 3 charges and regains ld3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the stone, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the legend lore spell.\n\nBy using the stone to cast legend lore, you communicate directly with the aboleth, and it shares its knowledge with you. The aboleth can't lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.\n\nThe aboleth koows where Lord Neverember's secret vault is located. It also knows that three keys are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon named Aurinax (red dragon instead?) inhabits the vault and guards its treasures.\n\n\\em{\\bold{Failed Memory.}} When your attunement to the Stone of Colorr ends, you must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving  throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A remove curse spell cast on you has a 20 percent chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a \\Spell{greater restoration} spell does so automatically.\n\n\\em{\\bold{Sentience.}} The Stone of Golorr is a sentient lawful evil magic ilem with an Intelligence or 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. In addition, the aboleth learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.\n\nThe Stone of Golorr hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see 'Sentient Magic Items' in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).\n\n\\em{\\bold{Personality.}} The Stone ofGolorr has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god.\n\n\\em{\\bold{Destroying the Stone.}} While in stone form, the aboleth isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Golorr is immune to all damage. Casting an \\Spell{antipathy/sympathy} spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and \\NCP{Golorr} the \\Monster{aboleth} appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see.\n\n\\em{\\bold{Eyes.}} The stone has three eyes that can be removed. If the stone is blinded, it is inert. With one eye restored, the Stone can communicate, but still not see the secrets it once contained. With 2 eyes restored, the Stone (and a character attuned to it) can now 'see' the location of the remaining Eye and the immediate area around it. With all 3 Eyes restored, the Stone is fully restored and operates normally again."

Each gem deals 1 bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the line.}{91-95}{A burst of colorful shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot radius. You and each creature in the area that can see must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.}{96-97}{The target's skin turns bright blue for 1d10 days. If you chose a point in space, the creature nearest to that point is affected.}{98-00}{If you targeted a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If you didn't target a creature, you become the target and must make the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instantly \\Condition{petrified}. On any other failed save, the target is \\Condition{restrained} and begins to turn to stone. While restrained in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming \\Condition{petrified} on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the target is freed by the \\Spell{greater restoration} spell or similar magic.}"

  description: "A warhammer is a type of weapon that consists of a heavy head with a spike or hammer face attached to a long handle. It is a popular weapon for both infantry and cavalry, and is used to crush armor, break shields, and deliver powerful blows.\n\nWarhammers come in a variety of sizes and weights, but they typically weigh between 4 and 10 pounds and have a head that is about 12 to 18 inches long. The head of a warhammer can be made of iron, steel, or bronze, and it may be sharpened or blunt. The handle of a warhammer is typically made of wood or metal, and it is usually about 3 to 4 feet long.\n\nWarhammers are typically used with two hands, and they are swung with a powerful overhead blow. The weight of the hammer helps to deliver a crushing blow, and the spike or hammer face can be used to puncture armor or break bones. Warhammers are also effective against unarmored opponents, as they can deliver powerful blows that can knock them to the ground.\n\nWarhammers are a versatile weapon that can be used in a variety of situations. They are effective in close combat, and they can also be used to break down doors and fortifications. Warhammers are a popular weapon of choice for knights and warriors.\n\nHere are some additional details about warhammers:\\list{They were used by both infantry and cavalry.}{They were effective against armor, shields, and unarmored opponents.}{They could be used to break down doors and fortifications.}{They were a popular weapon of choice for knights and warriors.}"
